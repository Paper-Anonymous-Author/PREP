2,B00000IZQI,[['Baby']],"This colorful car collection develops motor skills and hand-eye coordination while your child makes important discoveries about sorting and strategy. There are four vehicles, numbered 1 through 4, of graduated  sizes: a rattling green sports car, a blue police car with a revolving roof light, a yellow school bus with an opening sunroof, and a red fire truck with an adjustable clicking ladder. The vehicles can be rolled  across the floor, and then stacked--ever so carefully--atop each other, and finally all nested inside the fire truck. Vehicles only nest or stack completely when arranged in proper order of size and number. Made of sturdy plastic, these toys can be dipped in warm sudsy water for easy cleaning.--Kathryn Gustafson",Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,8.37,,,2

4,B00002JV9S,[['Baby']],"In a relatively new concept in teething, The First Years  introduces this massaging action teether. The concept is really quite  simple: offer even the youngest infants a means to massage their gums  at will. The massaging action increases circulation, thereby helping to  alleviate swelling and discomfort. This soft, yellow, star-shaped  teether has a smiling face and three nubby points that vibrate when a  child bites down on them. The star sits upon an oversized blue plastic  handle that's easy for even the youngest child to grasp. There's also  an opening at the bottom of the handle that accepts a toy strap. The  star rattle is surface washable and is powered by a nonreplaceable  battery that's sealed inside the teether's handle for maximum safety.--Tami Horiuchi",The First Years Massaging Action Teether,8.84,The First Years,,4

These Soft Teething Beads are attached to a  yellow plastic claspless cord. Twelve knobby beads make up the teether  so it's long enough for a baby to grasp with both hands. The beads are  good and knobbly so babies will be able to fully work their gums, and  while holding the chain babies will inadvertently practice gross motor  skills by pulling their hands away from each other. When a baby is done  using this teether it'll make a perfect necklace for dolls or a  counting and color toy.--Sandy Hirsch",The First Years Soft Teething Beads,6.09,The First Years,,5
6,B000034DCJ,[['Baby']],"Wear your baby?! Dr. William Sears, noted pediatrician and  author (with his wife Martha, a registered nurse) of child-care books,  includingThe Baby BookandParenting the Fussy Baby,  recommends it highly. His research reveals that parents who ""wear"" their  babies experience a deep bonding with them; babies cry less when comforted  by the close movement, touch, smell, and sound of a loved one; and such  babies spend more time in a state of ""quiet alertness,"" which is the optimal  state for learning. Designed by Dr. Sears to foster the physical and emotional  closeness of ""attachment parenting,"" the Babysling Cradle lets you carry your  baby (up to 20 pounds) in comfort and safety. The fabric sling with its  extra-padded elastic railing nestles baby in a natural position. Your  warmth and touch do the rest. Four positions (cradle, snuggle, kangaroo, and  hip straddle) accommodate baby and the situation--from nursing to shopping.  The Babysling Cradle comes with an instruction booklet.--Ava Natov",Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,,,,6

9,B00003TL7P,[['Baby']],"When dealing with a young baby or squirming toddler at diaper changing time, the last thing you need is a diaper pail that requires two hands. The Diaper Champ helps eliminate hassle&#x97;and odor&#x97;by providing convenient one-hand operation for quick disposals.Even better is that this wondrous device takes regular garbage bags. There is no need to constantly buy brand name refills because the Champ can use the typical tall kitchen sack, plus grocery or most other plastic bags. Aside from the use of regular bags making it the economical choice, this feature also makes the Champ more flexible. While diapers will no doubt be the most thrown away item, this pail can also accommodate wipes, cotton swabs, tissues, and other baby essentials.Functionality is simple: drop a diaper (or other trash) into the pail&#x92;s top receptacle and flip the handle. To empty, just unlock the top and remove the bag. Standing about two feet high, the Diaper Champ&#x92;s capacity is on par or larger than many of its competitors, usually only requiring a bag change once a week.But the true test of any diaper pail is its smell control, right? Most moms we polled claimed the Champ the hands-down winner, and only a few had occasional escaped odors after 18+ months of use. Once toddlers have been introduced to solid foods using scented bags can help fight off any excess pail smell. Another great tip for keeping the Champ fresh is to quickly spray it down with a disinfectant when changing bags.",Baby Trend Diaper Champ,35.49,,,9

25,B00004YMZE,[['Baby']],"Here is what a parent&#x92;s mantra should be when seeking a safety gate: Easy for me, difficult for child. Because really, what else do you need? A good-looking gate is nice, sure, and it&#x92;s important to have the right size for various entryways. But it all comes down to safety for the kid and ease-of-use for the parent. The Evenflo Top of Stair Gate meets and exceeds these stipulations. And it&#x92;s not bad looking, either!Perfect for High Traffic AreasDesigned to secure that most dangerous of crawler/toddler attractions, the stairs, the Top of Stair Gate features key safety elements, including four-point hardware mount, one-direction swing setting, and kidproof latch.Four-Point Hardware MountThis is an extremely secure mounting when used with the one-direction swing setting for the gate. A Phillips screwdriver and electric drill with 1/8-inch bit are required (not included). A mounting template is included for quick installation&#x97;this is a very useful benefit, as most parents spend far more time than they had originally planned or hoped, installing gates. The gate is easy to remove (leaving the hardware in the walls) for those times when you don&#x92;t need it and do want easier grownup access to the stairs.Swing MountCorrectly installed, the gate can swing both waysorbe used with the one-direction swing setting for top of stairs use. The usefulness of this setting becomes obvious when you consider the danger of the accidentally unlatched gate swinging open over the stairs&#x85;Childproof LatchTo open the gate, press in and slide out. You&#x92;ll hear an audible click. Once you&#x92;ve got the hang of it, it&#x92;s a quick, one-handed operation that will allow you to pass through the gate even while carrying a child&#x97;but foil even the most dexterous toddler&#x92;s attempts to break out.Vertical Bars: Not Just for Prison AnymoreVertical bars are crucial to any gate&#x92;s effectiveness. Amazingly, some gate manufacturers have not figured this out yet. A horizontal bar across a gate is an open invitation to climb. Evenflo, fortunately, has a firm grasp on this concept. The Top of Stair vertical bars&#x92; smooth, non-toxic, splinter-resistant finish thwarts little climbers.A Good, Basic GateStanding 30 inches tall and extending from 28 to 42 inches wide, the gate fits standard doorways and keeps children (up to 24 months) appropriately frustrated in their efforts to topple down stairs.--Emilie Coulter",Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,39.99,Evenflo,,25

Included are the sounds of a gentle, steady rainfall, the rhythmic ebb  and flow of waves crashing on a beach, and a medley of three different  lullaby melodies. The player can also simulate the sound of a muffled  heartbeat--a familiar sound that can be very helpful when trying to  calm a newborn. A large volume-control dial and a 15-minute timer  button make this well-designed player even more user-friendly. Requires  four AA batteries (not included).--Chris Burns",The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,30.88,The First Years,,34
35,B000056HND,[['Baby']],"At a distance, this portable crib could be mistaken for the  permanent variety. Up close, it's clearly something else: a smaller  item altogether, with a 2-inch mattress and board that lift out and two  locking latches. Pop the latches, and in less than a minute the whole  thing folds up to a mere 6 inches wide. In this configuration, it can  still be rolled on the four plastic casters (if care is taken that it  doesn't fall over). Two of the casters lock. Although the board and  mattress can be stored inside the folded frame, it's a pity the board  isn't simply hinged, as in some competing models; this would make setup  and storage slightly easier (and it would make dropping the board on a  toe more difficult). Also, the locking latches are a little hard to  figure out the first time; we've seen more traditional hardware that's  simpler, equally safe, and easier to use.--Richard Farr",Cosco Portable Crib - White,6.99,,,35

The  soft ""petals"" in the cushion send a message to the breast to stimulate a  natural let-down reflex, and the silicone diaphragm creates a vacuum to  help express more milk quickly and quietly.

Overall dimensions are 13 inches deep by 6 inches high by 14 inches  wide; that's a little bulky to drag around to restaurants, perhaps, but  ideal for making use of big-people chairs at home.

All they need to do is place the filled bottle in the warmer, fill the warmer with water, plug in, and wait for the neon light to flash on and off. In four to six minutes, baby has his bottle.The DetailsWhether a parent is heating breastmilk, formula, or pureed peas; using Avent bottles, other brands, or baby food jars; the Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer gently and evenly heats baby&#x92;s meal. The included plastic basket is used inside the warmer to keep baby food jars and Avent bottles upright. It can be removed when heating the Avent Magic cup and other makes of bottles. Water is added to just above the level of the milk in the bottle (or below the top of baby food jar). Plug the unit into an electrical outlet and click the switch on. A neon light will illuminate. Turn the dial to the appropriate setting (3 for Avent feeding bottles and baby food jars, and 2 for Avent Disposable System). When the bottle has been in the warmer for the appropriate length of time (a guide is included, based on whether the bottle is at room temperature or refrigerated to start), the light will flash. Test the temperature and reheat if necessary or serve.Don&#x92;t forget to switch the warmer off and unplug it!Why Not Just Use the Microwave?The microwave is never recommended for heating baby bottles or food. It&#x92;s difficult to judge just how much time is needed, and even brief heating can create ""hot spots,"" which can burn baby. In addition, important nutrients may be lost in microwave heating.How About Just Putting the Bottle in a Bowl of Warm Water?Sure, if you (and your baby) don&#x92;t mind standing by the sink waiting for the water from the tap to warm up, then waiting for the bottle to warm, checking, checking again, and again&#x85;Get Out of the KitchenMidnight runs back and forth to the kitchen are not high on the list of favorite activities for most parents. A pleasant bonus to using the Avent Express Warmer is that it can be set up in the bedroom, bathroom, nursery&#x85;anywhere there is an outlet. Having the bottle warmer and fixings set up close to the action (not too close, though&#x97;mind the safety precautions) can subtract minutes from the whole process. And as any parent will tell you, every minute counts.What&#x92;s in the BoxThe Avent Express warming system includes bottle-warming unit, basket, feeding spoon, four-ounce Avent bottle with top (nipple not included), and instruction manual with time/temperature guide. All Avent products work together and are completely interchangeable.Note: It is possible to overheat a bottle or jar of food with this system. If you find that a bottle is not warm enough after the allotted time, you may replace it in the warmer, but remember that, although the water surrounding the bottle will remain at a constant temperature, the contents of the bottle or jar will continue to heat. Always test the milk or food before feeding baby.

It can be used to sterilize Avent feeding bottles of varying sizes (and their nipples, rings, and dome caps), Avent Isis breast pump accessories, Via cups and lids, Via Disposable Nursers, and other non-electrical Avent products. Its compact size and ease of use make the sterilizer perfect for traveling, too.Protect Your Baby from BacteriaThe Avent Express II Microwave Sterilizer effectively and quickly kills the kind of household bacteria that can wreak havoc on babies&rsquo; delicate new systems. Establishing a routine of washing bottles and pump supplies in gentle, soapy water, then sterilizing them, will ensure that baby will have a clean start in life.No More Pots and Pans and Boiling WaterThe Avent Express is simplicity itself once you get the hang of it. After reading the detailed instructions with great care (assembly and loading are not completely intuitive, and there are important details that can make all the difference in safety and effectiveness of the sterilizer), pour the correct amount of water into the base. Load the pre-washed bottles and feeding components into the appropriate spots in the plastic rack, position the lid over the sterilizer base and lock the clips into place. (You&rsquo;ll hear a click.) Place the sterilizer in the center of the microwave, and select microwave wattage and timings (a chart is included to determine proper wattage and time). Allow the unit to cool for at least two minutes before removing the sterilizer from the microwave. Use the safety grips on the base&mdash;they stay cooler to ensure safer handling. If you don&rsquo;t remove the lid, the contents will stay sterile for up to 24 hours.Care and CleaningThe all-plastic sterilizer is dishwasher safe. Always drain the excess water from the unit and rinse to prevent the build-up of limescale. Always store when the unit is completely dry.What&rsquo;s in the BoxThe Avent Express II Microwave Sterilizer consists of a sturdy plastic base (11 inches in diameter) with safety grips; a bottle/accessory rack with dome cap stem, bottle cavity, nipple cavity, and Isis Breast Pump slots; and a lid with locking clips. It can be used with most standard microwaves with wattage range from 500 to 1,850 watts. The box also contains a detailed and illustrated instruction manual.Note: When taking the sterilizer out of the microwave, use great caution! It will still be hot, as will be the contents. When removing the lid, point it away from you to allow the steam to escape. Follow loading, assembling, and care instructions meticulously.--Emilie Coulter",Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,50.32,Philips Avent,,69

Any parent occupied with little ones and all of their necessities will quickly recognize this as a huge benefit. To operate, simply press on the pedal with your toes and then bump the knee plate with your knee. Closing is just a nudge in the opposite direction; you will hear a click when the latch has caught, offering peace of mind that it&#x92;s secure again.The convenient foot pedal is easy for adults, but difficult for children, to open.The pedal, knee plate, and hinges are designed so the gate can swing open from either direction. Even smarter is that the gate is purposely designed as easy-to-open for an adult, yet difficult for children. The gate&#x92;s vertical bars curb curious toddlers from trying to climb over, are spaced to help prevent painful accidents, and provide ample visibility through to the other side.Adjustable pressure mounts don&#x92;t require screws and won&#x92;t mark up your walls.Able to fit in standard doorframes (29"" to 34"" wide), the all-metal safety gate is a pressure-mount device.

It should be noted that this safety gate can be a little unsteady when used at the outer limits of its range, so you may want to consider an extension kit even if using in a standard doorway.Before you buy, there are two things to be aware of. One, the actual opening for parents, kids, and/or pets to walk through is only about 18 inches wide. Two, if you want to use this in a doorway and be able to close the door, the foot pedal sticks out too far to allow this.

It also keeps you from waking baby unnecessarily by letting you see if baby is really awake or just fussing in his sleep. The monitor comes with a camera, which mounts on either a wall or table top and pivots so you can adjust it at each bed- or naptime to get the best view of baby. A nighttime sensor automatically detects darkness and adjusts the picture so you can still see baby on the monitor. The monitor operates at a powerful 900-MHz frequency for a clearer picture and has two channels for better privacy. The monitor delivers sound as well as sight and illuminating lights show the sound level of babies' cries. As a bonus this monitor comes with a portable, battery-operated audio receiver, which allows parents to be out in the backyard or at a neighbor's house and still be connected to baby. The audio receiver clips onto a belt and has a volume control, illuminating sound lights, and a low-battery indicator.

The compact unit travels to and plugs in anywhere&#x97;a bedside table, a nursery, a hotel room, or the babysitter's house, keeping all the feeding accessories close at hand.

Newly mobile babies can push the walker around: the easy-grip plastic handle keeps hands steady, while four wheels ensure the walker won&#x92;t tip over easily.

The music box is (easily) attached to the crib bars, and the mobile with swiveling arm ascends from the box to hang over the crib, out of baby&#x92;s reach. One button on the music box starts a 15-minute cycle of music by Mozart, Beethoven, or Bach; or individual composers&#x92; buttons can be pushed if baby has a yen for 15 minutes of Bach, say. Goofy zoo animals sporting polka dots and multi-colored feet (a la Dr. Seuss) are angled to baby&#x92;s line of vision&#x97;not the parent&#x92;s.

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.What's In the BoxGraco SnugRide Infant Car Seat Base (Metallic Silver).Learn more about Graco Classic Connect vs Click Connect compatibility here.","Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",36.61,Graco,,202

Parents can install the car seat to be rear-facing for 5- to 35-pound babies, set it to a forward-facing position when the child weighs between 20 and 40 pounds, and then use it as a booster seat when kids weigh between 30 and 100 pounds. The Alpha Omega Elite secures using the LATCH system, which complies with current federal safety standards. The five-point harness restraint is easy to adjust and the chest clip is a cinch to open and close in a hurry. Padding on the shoulder straps, back, and headrest; fold-down armrests, and three reclining positions ensure your child's comfort. There is even a built-in cup holder alongside the base for a sippy cup. For parents' convenience, the harness has four different heights and the headrest moves with the straps so rethreading the straps is never necessary.

Meant to be used from birth until baby rolls over or pushes up on their own, the sleeper is anchored to your bed by a large flap that tucks under your mattress. The patented Airflow design of the hollow frame and breathable mesh fabric keep air circulating and baby cool.The sleeper folds up nicely for convenient portability and compact storage.A durable, cloth-covered U-shaped ""wall"" surrounds baby&#x92;s head and torso to limit their movement and help prevent parents from rolling onto them. The soft head barrier reduces the risk of entrapment, while the foot wedge--which can be used as a sleep positioner in future months--ensures baby stays snugly inside the sleep area. The supportive bottom is a cozy resting spot with the included soft cover, vinyl covered mattress, and removable, machine washable mattress sheet.Reassurance and safety weren&#x92;t the only things The First Years folks thought of when creating this sleeper.

288,B00016BPA2,[['Baby']],"The most important difference between the Medela Pump in Style Advanced model and the Original is that the Advanced pump includes a pretty remarkable feature that actually mimics a baby&#x92;s nursing rhythm by pumping in two distinct modes: let-down and expression. In the first few moments of nursing, babies initiate faster milk flow by suckling rapidly. After the flow is established, baby switches to slower, deeper suckling for maximum milk flow in less time. The ""Natural Expression"" system simulates this two-stage pattern for a highly efficient, effective pumping experience. In other ways the pump is similar to the also first-rate Original: a stylish and professional looking black shoulder bag houses the pump with adjustable speed and vacuum control, along with battery pack, AC adapter, four bottles with lids, bottle stands, ""PersonalFit"" breastshields, removable cooler carrier with ice packs, bottle holder, extra storage pockets, and a built-in picture frame for a photo of your pride and joy.

366,B0002TEG9U,[['Baby']],"So your baby has finally reached the stage where your lap is not the most exciting place to be anymore, and she's itching to get around and see new things! The only problem is that even though she's practically climbing out of your arms, she can't crawl or walk yet. Ease your baby's need to explore the world with the Safety 1st Grip'n Go Walker.Your baby is old enough to use this walker if she is able to sit without assistance; weighs less than 30 pounds; is less than 32 inches tall; and is not yet able to walk. If you baby fits these criteria, then keep on reading if you want your child to enjoy all the health and play benefits this walker has to offer.Whimsical characters surrounded by blinking lights and sounds will keep your baby entertained.View larger.The walker seat features machine-washable fabric for easy clean up.Special safety grips are designed to reduce sudden movement and prevent tipping.View larger.Designed with Safety in MindNot only does the Safety 1st Grip'n Go Walker meet all JPMA and ASTM safety standards, but this fun and colorful walker is also specially designed with several extra safety measures that will ensure your baby's safety as he or she moves around your house. For starters, the Grip'n Go features special safety grips located on the bottom of the walker that are designed to reduce sudden movement and the risk of tipping should your baby roam to an uneven surface in your house. Another special feature includes the safety brakes on the walker's back wheels that will keep the walker stationary during those times when you need to answer the phone or turn your back momentarily. And finally, special gripping handles are built into the walker that are designed to make your baby feel more secure.Easy to Construct, Easy to Use, and Easy to MaintainConstructed from durable, molded plastic, the Safety 1st Grip'n Go Walker is both lightweight -- essential, of course, for your baby to navigate easily -- and extremely easy to clean. The seat features machine-washable fabric for easy clean up, while the walker itself folds down in a few simple steps for quick and convenient storage. The walker's seat is also easily adjustable to three different heights, making this the ideal walker as your child grows. And best of all, the Grip'n Go Walker takes only minutes to assemble and requires no additional tools or special skills.The Ultimate Test DriveOur 9-month-old ""test baby"" learned to get around in the walker fairly quickly and was absolutely delighted with her newfound mobility. It's so mobile, in fact, that once you strap your baby into the walker, grown-ups and small pets will need to keep on their toes if they don't want to get run over! Our child, who is only now learning to crawl, suddenly became a fun-filled terror on wheels! We were also pleasantly surprised to discover that this walker makes a great stationary play station: simply put on the brakes and let your little one enjoy the attached toys to her heart's content. The included toys, with their whimsical, friendly faces, bendable bodies and fun blinking lights and sounds, provided our baby with loads of interactive, tactile fun. The front tray can easily serve as a spot for finger foods, or as a place to attach more toys to keep your child entertained safely in one spot while you attend to household chores or dinner. Also, we were relieved to find a toy that provided our child with tactile fun and exercise that required no batteries.The walker folds down in a few simple steps for quick, and convenient storage.View larger.A Brief Note on your Child's SafetyWhile the Grip'n Go Walker is built to provide your child with as healthy and safe an experience as she will ever experience in any walker, it's important to remember that these security measures do not replace adult supervision. Providing your baby with mobility requires constant parental supervision, so make certain never leave your baby unattended. Also, make sure that she is always on an even surface free of obstacles, and never allow your baby to use her walker near any stairs or steps. The Safety 1st Grip'n Go Walker addresses several issues that older-model walkers neglected. The advanced safety features of the Grip'n Go Walker, combined with vigilant parental supervision, will give your child -- and yourself -- all the rewards that newfound mobility in a fun and playful setting can offer. In short, with vigilant parental supervision, the Safety 1st Grip'n Go Walker can offer both parents and children the best of all worlds: it offers your child a safe and secure way to explore the world, while it gives you a safe and secure -- and stationary -- place to set your baby for those few moments you need a break.Pros:Provides infants with the exciting ability to explore the worldDoubles as a safe and secure stationary play stationDurable, lightweight, easy to use and maintainCons:Requires constant and vigilant adult supervision to ensure your child's safety",Safety 1st Grip 'n Go Walker,,,,366

If movement alone doesn&#x92;t work, the swing plays eight different songs and three relaxing ocean sounds at the volume level of choice.

414,B0006HBRXQ,[['Baby']],"This LATCH-equipped car seat converts from a rear-facing unit for infants (up to about 30 lbs.), to a forward-facing seat for kids at least a year old (up to 65 lbs.). To that end, the seat necessarily comes with belts, padded harnesses, and tethers--along the groin, waist, and shoulders--to prevent wobbling and leaning, and to allow the seat to be secured in cars that do not accommodate a LATCH system. It is therefore versatile enough for almost any car. Foam padding protects the head and sides, while two reclining positions make the ride even more enjoyable. The one caveat: the seat&#x92;s floral design may match your grandmother&#x92;s upholstered sofa from 20 years ago. But, unlike your grandmother&#x92;s sofa, this seat is not only machine-washable and stain-proofed, it&#x92;s removable and replaceable.

415,B0006HBRY0,[['Baby']],"Britax International has been manufacturing innovative, industry-leading child products for over three decades. Their dedication to safety, comfort, and convenience is certainly apparent in this convertible car seat. Its ample attributes&#x97;both for parents and baby&#x97;and amazing attention to safety standards, make the Marathon a true front runner.Safety first is a good rule of thumb, and one that Britax certainly heeds. The Marathon offers features you might find on many other car seats, such as convertibility, a five-point harness, and the LATCH system. But Britax enhanced and then went above and beyond the norm when creating the Marathon.The Marathon can be easily rear-facing installed with today&#x92;s LATCH system.Their five-point harness system is made with strong polyester webbing, fits snugly over baby&#x92;s shoulders, collarbone and hips to provide a secure fit, and the straps are designed to remain tangle free. There are also four adjustable height positions so the seat grows with baby. A patented ""floating"" HUGS&#x99; (Harness Ultra Guard) system better distributes the webbing loads, reducing head movement and minimizing harness irritation on baby&#x92;s neck in case of an impact. HUGS also reduces the chance of improperly positioning the chest clip.Located near a vehicle's seatbelts, factory installed anchor points provide a secure and easy LATCH connection. In conjunction with this push-button release system, the Marathon also offers Britax&#x92;s Versa-Tether&#xAE;, an anchor aid that provides additional security in the forward facing position for children weighing more than 50 lbs. The Versa-Tether&#xAE; fastens the top of the car seat to factory installed automobile anchor points, minimizing the possibility of a head injury.The Marathon can also be safely used in cars without the LATCH system.Need more? The Marathon provides built-in lock-off clips that keep the seat tightly in place when using only traditional seatbelts at installation. A simple handle pull allows the car seat base to be easily reclined when rear-facing. A smooth ride is guaranteed for baby through the comfy padding and soft fabric cover, which is stain resistant, removable, and washable. The Marathon is Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 compliant, making it approved for airplane use as well.It should be noted that the Marathon is larger (28""H x 19.5""W x 25""D) than most car seats, and can be a tricky fit, especially in the rear facing position in a smaller car. Allow for 31"" of backseat space to properly accommodate this model. With its bigger size this car seat is also heavier than many. Completely empty the Marathon weighs nearly 18 pounds. But these same features are what allow the car seat to have a higher weight capacity and therefore last well into childhood.A simple handle pull allows the car seat base to be reclined when rear-facing.Since car seats are mandated by law, it&#x92;s nice to know that Britax is at least making the choice simple for you. The Marathon is easy to install, super comfortable for baby, available in a wide range of colors and patterns, and, most importantly, safe!Comparing Britax Car SeatsIf you&#x92;re debating between the Britax Marathon and theBritax Roundabout, think of the latter as the little sibling. They are identical in comfort and convenience features, but the Marathon has a higher weight maximum, and is therefore larger than the Roundabout.TheBritax Decathlonis also similar to the Marathon, but offers two features you might need. First, the Decathlon offers additional padding for newborns with an infant positioning system, giving more peace of mind to first time parents. Second, the Decathlon offers an adjustable three-position crotch strap, which makes the seat more comfortable for toddlers consistently at the top of their height percentage.","Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage",,,,415

First, the contoured, ergonomically designed handle fits easily in your hand. The handle also swivels, giving you the freedom to position your hand and then pump more comfortably on each breast.Two-Phase Expression TechnologyDesigned to feel more like your baby than any other manual pump, the Harmony features two-phase expression technology, an advanced pumping pattern that mimics a baby's natural nursing rhythm.This system works in two modes: the simulation mode and the expression mode. The simulation mode simulates your baby's initial rapid sucking to start your milk flowing, while the expression mode simulates your baby's slower, deeper suckling to express your milk gently yet efficiently. These modes work together to make pumping a quick and painless process.Convenient, Safe and User-Friendly DesignMedela knows that busy moms don't have the time or patience to struggle with complicated parts or to wait for the pump to stimulate milk flow. That's why the Harmony is designed for faster let-down.Additionally, this one-piece unit features fewer pieces to assemble and clean than traditional manual pumps, making it a snap to start pumping when and where you need to. Most importantly, the Harmony is a safe and sanitary way to provide your baby with healthy breast milk--all parts that come into contact with breast milk are 100-percent BPA/DEHP free. For added convenience, this pump is also upgradeable to electric pumping with the use of the Symphony or the Lactina conversion kits (not included), and it is backed with a 30-day limited warranty.About MedelaFounded in 1961 in Zug, Switzerland by Olle Larsson, Medela is committed to supporting the WHO Code's depiction of breastfeeding and breast milk as the optimal nutrition for the growth, development and health of babies. The company believes it is their obligation to offer a complete solution, ""from breast to belly,"" of high quality products that enable mothers to provide the optimum nutrition of breast milk to their babies.

Ensuring that the milk in the bottle flows out through the nipple while the air is channeled through a tube to the other end also eliminates another unique problem of bottle-feeding: nipple collapse. The positive-pressure design mimics breastfeeding and can be used with breast milk or formula.In Plain English, PleaseThe bottle prevents air bubbles from getting into baby&#x92;s tummy.No Air Bubbles, No GasAnd no gas, no colic&#x85;at least that&#x92;s the principle. At a minimum, baby will be more comfortable while his digestive system develops.A Note to ParentsThe first time parents use the Natural Flow system, they will need to be very conscientious about readingand followingthe detailed instructions. No shortcuts, please! Washing the bottle parts carefully is always important, and resisting the urge to become cavalier about mixing formula, heating milk, or checking for tears or cracks is important to your baby&#x92;s health and safety. Time spent attending to these details is well spent.What&#x92;s in the Box?Dr. Brown&#x92;s newborn feeding set includes everything needed to get started on the wonderful, ever-changing world of sustaining an infant (except the actual milk, that is): Three 8-ounce standard baby bottles, two 4-ounce standard baby bottles, five Level-One silicone nipples, two extra Level-Two silicone nipples (faster-flowing for the older baby), five 2-piece patented internal vents, two storage/travel caps, three cleaning brushes, and instructions.--Emilie Coulter",Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set,21.79,Dr. Brown&#39;s,,429

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.What's in the BoxGraco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame.",Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,119.89,,,440

Is she coughing?Is she breathing?Every new parent (and one or two veteran ones, too) knows this scenario. It&#x92;s lovely when your baby sleeps, but it sure would be nice to keep an eye on her, too. But there aren&#x92;t too many parents around who have the luxury of sitting quietly in baby&#x92;s bedroom, watching her sleep. This is why baby monitors were invented. And traditional audio monitors are a terrific boon to modern parents.

From anywhere in the house, no less! Sound lights visually show baby&#x92;s level of activity, while nighttime LED lights on the camera make the baby fully visible day and night. Simply push one button on the parent unit to take a peek, then push the same button when you&#x92;re reassured enough to rely on the sound lights for a while. With a 350-foot range, you can carry the monitor receiver everywhere you go, even into the yard.

Rather than allowing them to lurk underfoot on the bathroom floor or sit forlornly in the empty tub once the splish-splashing is over, why not scoop 'em up with the ever-so-cute Frog Pod? This bright green plastic frog can be mounted on any bathroom wall with the included bracket and adhesive. A built-in shelf at the top stores shampoo or other bath products, while (this is the best part) the removable scoop can be used to pick up, rinse, and drain toys. Additional toys or scrubby sponges can be hung from the frog's splayed fingers and toes. There's plenty of room for toys (no more than 10 pounds worth is the packaging caution - 10 pounds!), and the design is charming and appealing to grownups and kids alike. To avoid trouble with the Frog Pod falling off the wall, make sure to follow mounting directions carefully. It's especially important to use a dry wall, allow for a long adhesive curing time, and don't cross the grout with the adhesive strips. Once it's really on, the frog pod should provide handy, stylish, and mildew-free bath toy storage for a good long time.

Baby can pull its ears, which make a crinkly sound that babies like, and feel its nubby nose, as well as explore the other soft textures on the mat. And because babies are fascinated with bold, contrasting imagery and with facial features, your infant will also like looking at the monkey's big, black-and-white eyes.Your baby can lie on the mat on his back to interact with the activity arch above. It features three bright, interesting, and interactive toys, including a plush zebra, a baby-proof mirror that gives baby the opportunity to discover his own face, and a cute monkey that plays a short melody when you pull its tail.When you and your baby are finished playing, you can easily zip up the mat to store it away. The activity arch detaches easily and can be quickly installed over your baby's crib, making for more versatile use.A Toy to Grow with Your Little OneThe Merry Monkey Gym offers plenty of opportunity for growing and learning. We especially like that the characters on the activity bar are angled to make important ""eye contact"" with the baby, which isn't always the case with activity mats. This mat also encourages the ""tummy time"" that pediatricians recommend for infants for strengthening neck and arm muscles. Unlike some other mats, the Merry Monkey provides enticements for your baby to spend more time on his tummy with its interesting colors, textures, and fabrics.The Merry Monkey is designed to grow with your little one through several stages of his early development: as a newborn he'll love just looking at the characters and watching you interact with the toys -- but before you know it, he'll be reaching for them himself with his hands and feet, and rolling over on his own to play with the monkey's ears.Finally, this activity mat's compact size and relatively inexpensive price tag make the Merry Monkey an economical choice. It is a bit smaller than other activity mats on the market, which give your baby a bit more room to play, but its compact size makes it easy to store and carry without sacrificing fun or educational quality.",Infantino Merry Monkey Gym,27.99,Infantino,,543

Plush and soft, with a sturdy plastic shell, this nightlight is best placed on the floor in the center of the room, where it projects a starry night sky onto the ceiling and walls. For interactive fun, parents can also sit with their children and identify and describe the features of eight major constellations, including the Big Dipper and the Big Bear, with the help of the beautifully illustrated Star Guide. The Twilight Turtle also includes a warm-hearted story about how Twilight Turtle, separated from his father, uses the constellations to find his way home.User-Friendly OperationSimply pressing the button on the turtle's shell ignites the stars and keeps them glowing for a full 45 minutes--just enough time for most children to drift into sleep. At this point, the Twilight Turtle automatically shuts off to preserve battery life. Another push of the button reactivates the projection. In addition, the easy selection of the three soothing color choices allows your child not only to learn to identify different colors, but also to truly experience them as well. Amber radiates warmth and peace; green creates a healing and renewing atmosphere; and blue helps calm the senses. The soft, illuminating glow the Twilight Turtle emits also serves as a nightlight that makes the darkness less frightening.Makes a Great GiftA great gift for children who are afraid of the dark, or even adults who have trouble falling asleep, the Twilight Turtle runs on three ""AAA"" batteries (included).

607,B000CS7SLO,[['Baby']],"Rock-a-bye Baby Bjorn&#x85;From the first name in front carriers for babies comes a handsome bouncy seat that any parent would be proud to position in the living room among the leather sofas and sleek coffee tables. But don&#x92;t be fooled. This seat is far, far more than a fashion accessory for image-conscious parents.The bouncy seat is one of the most important and useful pieces of baby gear most families will have in their homes. It would be lovely if we could all sit around with our babes in arms all day, every day; alas, dishes, laundry, dinner, and older children call. Bouncy seats allow the youngest members of the family to enjoy the chaos swirling around them from the comfort and peace of their own personal recliner. And in a pleasantly pared-down departure from the jingly-jangly, swishy-splashy seats that confront parents shopping for a basic bouncy seat, the only bell or whistle on the Baby Sitter 1-2-3 is a toy bar with three solid wood teddy bear shapes. No cutesy faces, no fancy textures or fabrics, no I.Q.-enhancing games and sound effects. No batteries.This bouncy seat simply, well, bounces. The slightest movement causes a relaxing bounce--no on/off buttons or six degrees of vibration, just baby&#x92;s natural wiggling. Depending on your tot&#x92;s mood and wakefulness, the seat can be adjusted to three different positions for sleeping, resting, and playing. The deep recline is terrific for daytime snoozes, while the most upright position will be especially handy when baby gets a little older and is ready for more interaction with the world.The seat can be adjusted to three different positions for sleeping, resting, and playing.The attractive black fabric of the seat cover is reversible, from flat black to flat black with a diagonal pattern of a million faint gray ""Baby Bjorn""s. Either way, the look is subtle, sophisticated, and unforgiving of yogurt or rice cereal stains&#x85;Luckily, it&#x92;s easily machine washable (drip dry). Come to think of it, in this day and age, any piece of baby gear that is not machine washable needs to go straight to the museum of ancient artifacts, for crying out loud. The restraint system buttons (yes, buttons!) securely at three points, and is removable to wash, reverse patterns, or keep off entirely once baby is able to walk or to climb in and out of the seat herself.That&#x92;s right, you read that correctly! No need to scold your toddler for trying to get into baby&#x92;s seat; this bouncy seat is suitable for 8-pound newborns as well as kids up to 24 months (or a maximum of 29 pounds). Just be sure to remove and stow that restraint system. Another good safety feature is the non-skid base, as well as the reminder never to place the inhabited seat on a table or other elevated surfaces.Unlike the two- or three-month life spans of so many toys and equipment for children, this is one baby item that will truly grow with your little angel, up to two years! Even if it costs a bit more than some, make sure you&#x92;re measuring that price against the number of months of use; most bouncy seats are workable up until around seven months or so, in spite of the actual age/weight range listed. This will serve as a cool seat for an eighteen-month-old, as well as a cozy bouncy for an infant.Collapsible to a width of about four inches, the Baby Sitter 1-2-3 will easily accompany families to Grandma&#x92;s house, restaurants, tropical resorts&#x85; The Baby Bjorn Baby Sitter 1-2-3 is the proud and deserving recipient of the Practical Parenting Best Buy award as well as best in test in Swedish parenting magazine. Elegantly simple, the minimalist design is so appealing for parents already weary of the jarringly bright colors and tinny sounds of so many bouncy seats (and other baby paraphernalia). Plus it&#x92;s great for photo ops &#x96; no distracting background!--Emilie Coulter","BABYBJORN Baby Sitter 1-2-3 Activity Bouncer, Black Gingham",44.73,,,607

635,B000ELIXXQ,[['Baby']],"Baby care requires so much time and vigilant attention. Any appliance that takes the guesswork (and a few precious minutes) out of the endless feeding routine is a blessing to caregivers. The Avent IQ24 Sterilizer is a relatively small, simple appliance that sterilizes up to six (Avent brand) bottles and/or screw rings, nipples, pacifiers, and breast pump components in just six minutes. The contents then stay sterile for six hours, providing the lid is not removed. An optional second mode keeps bottle- and breastfeeding accessories sterile for up to 24 hours by continuously repeating the cycle, so baby can have clean, sterile bottles day and night. And as we know, babies actively require feeding 24/7, so this is no idle bonus!A Sterilizer with an IQThe Avent iQ24 Electronic Steam Sterilizer is so named because the makers consider it an ""intelligent"" product, using ""advanced iQ technology."" And it really is pretty smart. The machine communicates each phase of the sterilization cycle, so you never have to guess whether the bottles or breast pump accessories are actually sterile yet. A digital display, electronic countdown, and sound alerts give parents the assurance that baby will not be contaminated with the bacteria that lurk in unclean feeding equipment. Another cool feature is the ability to ""pause"" the cycle (again, read the instructions to do this properly!) in order to remove some items without interrupting the cycle.Putting the Sterilizer TogetherAlthough the iQ24 Sterilizer is relatively easy to assemble and use, it&#x92;s not necessarily intuitive. In other words, you&#x92;re probably going to have to read the instruction manual pretty carefully the first time around. After that, it should be a piece of cake. Basically, there is a pot with power cord, a lower basket, a bottle rack, an upper basket (plus a spare upper basket), a lid, measuring cup, and tongs. Two 9-ounce bottles are included, as well, along with nipples, screw rings, and dome caps. The baskets and bottle rack slide onto a central stem, and the bottles and breast pump components are placed in the appropriate baskets or rack. The sterilizer cleverly uses bottle screw rings to separate the baskets and bottle rack, putting the very items to be sterilized to good secondary use! Once the correct amount of water is added and all parts are assembled and loaded (and that&#x92;s the hardest part, figuring out which basket and bottle parts go where), simply plug the sterilizer body into an electrical outlet, select mode one or two (for six-hour or 24-hour sterilization cycles), and wait six minutes (for either mode). You&#x92;ll also need to study the information pamphlet for a translation of the various beeps and flashing lights on the display, but generally it will be obvious when the sterilization cycle has begun and ended, and what to do next (feed that baby!).Dishwasher BasketAs a bonus feature, two baskets can be clipped together to hold small items such as nipples, breast pump parts, pacifiers, etc., for washing in the top rack of your dishwasher prior to sterilization. Keep in mind that Avent items may discolor over time if they are washed in the dishwasher with dirty dishes covered with remnants of strong sauces, such as tomato or curry sauce.Note: Sterilization is not the same as, nor should it replace, washing! All bottles and breast pump supplies should be washed carefully in mild, soapy water, and rinsed, before sterilizing. Also, for optimal effectiveness of the sterilizer, and to reduce limescale build-up, use distilled water for sterilizing. Regardless of whether you use tap or distilled water, you should de-scale the sterilizer every four weeks or so (read manual for instructions).--Emilie Coulter","Philips Avent iQ24 Sterilizer with 2 Bottles, 9 oz",49.0,,,635

Granted, leaning back into the unknown, getting suds in the eyes, allowing Mom or Dad to pour cups full of water over your head, or banging your noggin on the faucet&#x97;none of this would be on a grownup&#x92;s list of favorite things to do, either. So kids and parents will both be tremendously relieved to discover Flo, a water deflector and faucet cover that turns a regular bathtub faucet into a gentle, safe waterfall. Children won&#x92;t mind leaning back into the soft spray of water, especially since the rubbery material of the deflector will make any inadvertent bumps pain-free. However, the chance of bumps is much less because Flo redirects the downward stream of water out and away from the faucet. The entire shampooing process will take place many inches away from the source of most injuries. No need for bathers to contort their bodies anymore to get directly under the flow.  Best of all (for image-conscious parents), Flo is handsomely designed, sleek and stylish&#x97;no yellow duckies here! When it&#x92;s time for a grownup shower, the shower diverter remains accessible through the upper portion of the faucet cover, so you won&#x92;t need to remove it after every bath.Let It FloInstallation of the Flo couldn&#x92;t be easier.

Make sure the front of the faucet extends over the inside flap, and that the shower diverter is accessible through the top opening.Bubbles, With Little Toil or TroubleA one-touch bubble bath dispenser releases liquid bubble soap into the flow of water, ensuring a tub full of fluffy, foamy fun. Pour liquid bubble bath into the reservoir at the top end of the Flo, then press the green button on the lower end where the water comes out.ProsKids of all ages will love playing in the soothing spray from the deflector, and will be far less likely to resist a shampoo rinse when it&#x92;s under a ""waterfall."" Flo&#x92;s simple design is attractive to grownups and children alike.ConsAlthough the cover is designed to fit easily over any standard bathtub faucets, there are definitely some faucets that it will fit better&#x97;or worse&#x97;than others. The Flo is easy to attach&#x85;but it can be fairly easy to remove, too, which is not always ideal when it&#x92;s a curious one-year-old doing the detaching. The bubble dispenser does not always work optimally, but presumably that&#x92;s not what most parents will be looking for in a protective cover/water deflector, anyway. And with some engineering (a.k.a. wiggling the cover around), the bubble dispenser issues can often be resolved.--Emilie Coulter","Boon Flo Water Deflector and Protective Faucet Cover with Bubble Bath Dispenser,Green",14.99,Boon,,704

That's why the Radian80 features a patented steel alloy frame that offers unparalleled durability without a bulky plastic structure. Compared to other car seats, Radian also offers extra shoulder room, more leg support and fits three across in a car. Additionally, it has a three-inch longer seat bottom, provides infant body support and features adjustable head cushions for a comfy ride.For added convenience, the Radian 80 is still the only car seat in the world that folds flat to a compact seven inches, so it's perfect for traveling. And because many cars do not allow top tether use with a child above 48 pounds, the LATCH-compatible Radian 80 can be used without a top tether with children who weigh up to 80 pounds.The Radian 80 helps ensure proper positioning with a five-point harness, five shoulder positions and three buckle positions. EPS safety foam provides four-panel side impact protection in case of an accident, while the V-shaped top tether adds stability.SafeStop SystemFor an extra measure of security in the car, the Radian 80 features SafeStop, a patented, energy absorbing harness system for added safety. This load-limiting harness device absorbs crash energy impacting a child in an accident by reducing peak forces on the chest and neck by up to 30 percent. This is especially important for smaller children, who typically have higher head weight to body weight ratios.Safety TestedAn iParenting Media Award winner, the Radian 80 has been crash tested according to U.S. safety standard FMVSS213 and has met all requirements with extraordinary success. In fact, Radian significantly outperformed the crash test criteria required for a 65 pound child. Beyond its high safety rating, the Radian 80 is easy for parents to use and care for. It features a soft and durable 100 percent polyester ultra suede cover, measures 17.0 x 28.5 x 16.0 inches (WxHxD) when open, and weighs 22 pounds.

It also creates a tranquil environment with four soothing sounds, from Mother's heartbeat (a steady thumping) to the gentle rhythms of nature. You and baby will both relax as you listen to the quiet stream, spring showers, swooshing ocean waves and harmonious whale sounds, making the Sleep Sheep a kind of audio pacifier that helps take some of the stress and crankiness out of rest time.Perfect for NaptimeMany babies find it hard to settle in their cribs when noises from both inside and outside the house distract and disrupt them. They crave repetitive, comforting rhythms that don't frighten them. The Sleep Sheep creates a kind of white noise that blocks out the other surrounding sounds, so babies can be lulled into sleep. This parents-little-helper also comes with a Velcro tab so you can secure the Sleep Sheep to the outside of a crib.User-Friendly OperationThe Sleep Sheep features user-friendly operation that both big and little hands can handle. Select sounds by simply pressing the push button, and then choose the most comfortable volume. For added convenience and to save battery power, the sounds automatically time out after 23 minutes--enough time for baby to fall into a comfortable and restorative sleep.Compact and lightweight, the Sleep Sheep stands 12 inches tall and takes two ""AA"" batteries (included). The sound box removes if your child simply wants to use the Sleep Sheep as a stuffed toy, and clean-up is a snap--just wipe the surface with soap and water.About Cloud bCloud b, the baby sleep specialist, was established by two new mothers with the philosophy that every baby deserves a sound night's sleep for healthy development. That's why all of Cloud b's products are developed in consultation with an advisory board of pediatricians and sleep specialists with a single focus: to achieve a better, safer sleep for baby.What's in the BoxOne Sleep Sheep and two ""AA"" batteries.The Sleep Sheep offers:Cuddly plush toy that provides soothing sounds.Built-in Velcro strap for easy attachment to strollers and car seats.Timer shuts off the sound after either 23 or 45 minutes.Shown here together with smaller,on-the-go Sleep Sheep.","Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep",29.95,Cloud b,,756

During the first months of life, babies learn how to move their bodies and gain the necessary physical strength for rolling over, sitting up, and crawling. Besides the physical benefits of tummy time, giving your infant playtime on his belly will help minimize any flat spots on his head that may have come from sleeping on his back.The Spin and Explore offers both you and your baby a soft and safe space to make tummy time a pleasurable part of everyday activities. Baby can gently and comfortably spin around on her tummy, stretching and strengthening her upper and lower body while enjoying lots of squeaky, crinkly, tactile fun. After your baby can sit up on her own, you can remove the spinner and let her take advantage of the other visually and physically stimulating features, like the peek-a-boo leaf flap and mirror.Fun, Innovative DesignWinner of Redbook's ""Hottest Toys of the 2007 Holiday Season,"" and a Toy Insider 2007 Top 20 pick, the Spin and Explore provides an innovative platform with a unique shape and rotating motion to encourage exploration and give babies the confidence they need to try new things. As his coordination grows, baby is more likely to want to attempt new skills--like twirling around on his tummy to visit his garden pals for tactile play, interaction that motivates him to hold his head up, use his legs, and spin on his stomach.The Spin and Explore can be used with or without the platform and also includes little loops to attach other toys to the play mat.

Whether flying on an airplane or traveling by train or bus, it is safest and most comfortable for your child to be in a car seat. But traveling with a young child, their seat, and your carry-on can be tricky. Not anymore. The Traveling Toddler strap allows you to attach your LATCH and top tether equipped toddler's car seat to a rolling carry-on suitcase. Simply attach the LATCH and top tether straps from the car seat to the Traveling Toddler and adjust the straps so that the car seat is held securely on the suitcase. Once adjusted, the car seat can be detached and reattached to the suitcase in seconds. Lift the handle of your carry-on bag and you have a fun new stroller. Now there's an easy and inexpensive way to take your toddler's car seat and other gear on your trip. You do not have to buy a special seat or suitcase. As long as your suitcase handle locks in place, you can push it like a stroller. Your hands are free for check in and its simple to unhook for security. Keep your child safe and comfortable in their own seat. The Traveling Toddler has been tested with most major car seat brands including Graco, Eddie Bauer, Cosco, Evenflo, and Britax, and a variety of carry-on suitcases and has worked with every combination. It is important that the telescoping handle of your suitcase locks in place. If not, it might not stay extended when you try to push your child in front of you, though you would still be able to pull them. If flying, make sure that your car seat is FAA approved before traveling. The Traveling Toddler strap is made from heavyweight polypropylene webbing that will withstand 900 lbs of force. When not in use it easily slips in the pocket of your carry-on. As with any other wheeled child carrier, do not use the Traveling Toddler on stairs or escalators.

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process.

But we were especially delighted by the magnetic drawing board that includes cute character shapes that let babies make their own, erasable drawings. And the piano keyboard, which has three play modes, features fun, upbeat music that's actually catchy to listen to. It also plays piano tones and cartoonish, animal voices.Perks for Baby and ParentsWe love the ingenuity of the Around We Go station's set up. Rather than keeping your baby stationary like other activity centers, it helps him satisfy his urge to move; he actually can make himself go from one point to another by using his feet. This gives baby vital, leg-strengthening exercises in a much safer and secure environment than baby walkers. There are perks for parents, too: you can lock the baby seat in place in front of the included snack tray to let him snack safely, and the seat fabric is easily removable and conveniently machine washable.One drawback: this toy is a bit cumbersome, which may present a problem if your living space is limited. However, the seat easily detaches from the table for more compact storage. In fact, when your baby is able to walk on his own, he doesn't have to abandon this toy: simply remove the seat, and he can play at the table independently.This toy requires adult assembly. You'll need a Phillips screwdriver, as well as three C batteries for the toy piano.What's in the BoxActivity station, seat carrier, assembly hardware, and instruction guide.The Around We Go supports babies as young as 4 months old and can sit unassisted.View larger.Babies will find the activities fun and developmentally challenging.View larger.","Bright Starts Around We Go Activity Station, Tropical Fun",85.0,,,945

The Cozy Comfort has a curve shaped, shoulder support design, that contours to the shoulder and provides a soft sleep.  Another problem examined by Today's Mom is lumbar support.  The Cozy Comfort correctly supports mother's weight while she sleeps.  An important upgrade mother's demanded was belly support.  This maternity body pillow features a belly support allowing the tummy to rest and support the baby comfortable.  Perhaps the best feature is the large, square head rest area.  Other pillows feature a flimsy, oddly shaped area for the head.  The Cozy Comfort's head support resembles a standard pillow to provide comfort. Good maternity pillows are hard to find.

1044,B000P7RIOY,[['Baby']],"When a toddler first has the opportunity to eat a meal from the same surface as one's parents, the experience often imbues the young child with a great sense of achievement and importance. The significance is clear: the child has developed skills that he or she did not previously possess. Once the toddler achieves this dexterity, the baby high chair with its dinky tray no longer has a place at the dinner table. However, a toddler still requires a boost to reach the dinner plate, necessitating a tray-less high chair. Familiar from use in family restaurants around the world, this Lipper International wooden high chair offers toddlers a secure seat for tableside eating. Lipper designed the chair for children 1- to 3-1/2- years old, or up to 35 pounds in weight. Simple yet practical, the high chair aesthetically blends into many kitchen and dining room d&#xE9;cors with ease.The high chair prevents tipping with its durable and weighty beech wood construction and a sturdy 19-1/2-by-21-inch base. The seat stands 20 inches from the floor, while the armrest dowel hovers 7 inches over the seat. A 9-inch high seatback with a broad wooden slat keeps the child sitting upright. A 3-point safety strap system secures the child with a lap belt, which threads through the crouch restraint. To reduce splinter potential, a non-toxic pecan finish smoothes the wood surface. Subtly rounded corners also decrease the risk of injuries. Easy to clean, wipe the high chair down with a damp cloth. Use a mild soap on marks and dry immediately to prevent water damage. Upon delivery, the chair requires some assembly with tools. The Thailand-made chair also comes with cherry or natural finishes. The high chair measures 20 by 19-3/4 by 28-3/4 inches and weighs 16 pounds upon shipping.--Jessica Reuling","Lipper International 516P High Chair, Pecan",54.16,Lipper International,,1044

1159,B000UEA96G,[['Baby']],"In just two minutes, milkscreen&#8482; quickly and accurately analyzes breast milk for alcohol. Every mother is unique so, naturally, the way our bodies metabolize alcohol is unique, too. Metabolizing alcohol depends on several factors including body weight, type of alcohol consumed, and food intake so milkscreen&#8482; was created to eliminate those variables. milkscreen&#8482; also helps ensure that the alcohol concentrated in Mom&#8217;s breast milk is not at a level that may have negative impacts on Baby. Studies have shown infants consuming breast milk with alcohol concentrations at approximately 30mg/dl, or 0.03%, and higher have exhibited distinctive changes in feeding behavior and sleep. Babies consume less if the milk contains alcohol and they also sleep less and wake more frequently. We&#8217;ve set the milkscreen&#8482; test to show a color change at 0.02% to help Mom stay within recommended feeding guidelines.",Milkscreen: Home Test to Detect Alcohol in Breast Milk 8 Test Strips,16.99,Milkscreen,,1159

Distinct sensations recreate a mother's movements and address the multi-sensory needs of infants. Developed with significant scientific research, the Sweetpeace calms baby via four of the senses: sight, sound, scent, and touch.Sight: Because newborns need visual simplicity, the Sweetpeace is made with neutral colors for a calming effect, has an adjustable canopy to control incoming light, and hosts a mirror that helps baby settle by focusing on their reflection.Sound: Comforting, low-frequency sounds recreate the in utero experience, while high-quality music offers sleepy songs for quiet times or upbeat songs for alert times. There is also a nature sounds (wind, rain, ocean waves) option, or an MP3 plug-in connection and holder allows you to create baby&#x92;s customized playlist.Scent: A parent&#x92;s scent is most recognizable and soothing to baby. The Sweetpeace includes removable soft components (a swaddling blanket and head support) that can be infused with nature&#x92;s ""aromatherapy"" and calm baby with the familiar smells.Touch: A 2-speed vibration calms and relaxes with a subtle ""massage"" while the 5-point harness offers gentle ventral pressure that simulates ""hugging."" The Soothing Center also moves like mothers do. It has four unique seating positions that imitate how you hold baby, four cradling motions, three recline positions, and six speeds that can be adjusted to baby&#x92;s mood.No tools are necessary to assemble the Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center.Babies (and parents) are calmed by the Sweetpeace&#x92;s multi-sensory technology.As if all of this wasn&#x92;t enough to make you wish you had one of these when you were a baby, Graco threw in some other thoughtful features. The removable seat doubles as an infant carrier or a floor rocker. On the flip side, the Soothing Center&#x92;s frame is car seat-compatible and accepts all Graco infant car seats.

For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.",Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,112.65,,,1226

In their first year, babies will spend over two-thirds of their time on their mattress, so concerned Mums and Dads will want the most natural, comfortable, breathable, hypo-allergenic and safe sleeping environment for their new baby a Natural Mat. Babies are very temperature sensitive. They easily become too hot, they sweat to cool down, and if they are not on a breathable surface, that sweat can pool, causing them to get chilled. This cycle leads to an unhappy, crying baby and a poor night sleep for all. Coco Mat is our most breathable, 100% organic mattress. Filled with coir from the world's only certified organic coconut plantation, the coconut husks are made into a supportive and breathable fibrous layer. The coir is then wrapped in organic lambswool that has been bathed in a mixture of lavender, lemon and eucalyptus rendering it dust-mite free, and providing the excellent thermal insulating properties of wool (it keeps baby warm when it is cool out, and cool when it is hot). These layers are covered in two organic cotton covers the top one is removable, and can be washed in hot water (140 F water keeps the mattress continuously dust-mite free). All of our mattresses are hand-made in Devon, England and use no chemicals, plastics or PVCs. Constructed with completely organic and renewable materials sourced from the finest, most qualified organic suppliers in the world, Natural Mat mattresses provide much higher levels of spring and support, and far better ventilation than any synthetic foam or coil spring mattress. Natural Mat mattresses fit US crib sizes and pass all US flame retardant standards without the use of chemical or unnatural treatments in any part of the mattress.

Each rear wheel operates independently with a spring/air suspension for a very smooth ride. With no rear axle it allows for maximum stride length. The frame is made from 6061 aircraft aluminum and the aluminum footrest (not plastic) enhances frame strength. These are features usually found on strollers costing several hundred dollars more. Combine the higher handle and neoprene parent organizer and you get absolute comfort! Also, enjoy the giant storage basket with easy accessibility.

It stands on a base, with the infant bucket seat attached to two arches by adjustable, spring-loaded straps. When baby is placed in the seat, he can kick off the ground with his legs to bounce up and down. This provides vital exercise for a youngster's legs, helping to prepare him for walking. The six-point height adjustment lets it grow with your infant, while non-skid feet and fabric-covered springs keep baby safe.Most bouncers stop there -- but we're delighted to find that the Activity Jumper also surrounds baby with plenty of fun, interactive toys. The bucket seat can rotate 360 degrees for baby to reach all of the activities. He'll delight in the frog spinner, bead chaser, and baby-proof mirror. The toy also includes 10 Baby Einstein links that can be repositioned and detached from the activity center for on-the-go play, or which serve as attachment points for additional toys.A teether stalk toy helps soothe itchy gums while encouraging ""reach and grab"" coordination. And the light-up piano keys give baby an interactive introduction to musical creativity with two modes: the ""piano notes"" mode plays in piano tones, while the ""melodies"" mode features five classical melodies.Help Your Little One Get StrongerBabies love bouncing. Not only is it exciting for a baby to move himself with the power of his own legs, but it gives him satisfying, and vital, exercise that helps prepare him for standing and walking. The higher and harder that baby bounces in the Activity Jumper, the more the toys will rattle and shake -- making it even more exciting and fun. And with the added benefit of a rotating seat, which baby operates by pushing off the ground with his feet, your infant gets even more leg coordination practice in a safe, secure place. We especially enjoy the versatility of this 2-for-1 toy -- and it's safer than an infant walker.Other perks for parents: the fabric seat cover is a cinch to remove, and it's machine washable. And unlike some other bouncers, the Activity Jumper folds down flat for much easier storage. While it's erected, however, it takes up a bit of room. And because your baby won't be able to use this toy once he's able to stand and walk unassisted, it has a limited-use timeframe.What's in the BoxActivity jumper, assembly hardware, quick start guide, and user's guide.","Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Green",117.79,,,1343

This is why we love the idea of a baby swing; we've seen how they provide a comfortable, safe place for an infant, with soothing, rocking motions to help maintain a very important sense of security and calm. If you're familiar with older models of baby swings -- with their creaky mechanical noises and uncomfortable seats -- you should know that the Zen Collection swing definitely takes baby swings to another level.The swing's seat is designed for infants who cannot yet sit unassisted. Its basket shape provides security and support for the youngest babies, and it can be adjusted to sit the baby up or recline down. A plush seat cover, padded head support, and built-in cover keep baby comfortable. The swing seat can be positioned to move back and forth or from side to side, and it has a speed-control dial to allow for a variety of graduated speed settings. The swing is powered by battery or can be plugged in with the included adapter. It moves in a smooth, quiet motion with minimal mechanical noise. While baby is swinging, he can listen to one of 14 different soothing sounds with adjustable volume, including Muzak-esque remixes of classical favorites and unobtrusive nature sounds, like chirping birds and babbling brooks.Knowing parents will especially appreciate that the baby seat is removable and portable. So once baby falls asleep in the swing, you don't have to disturb him by removing him from the seat. Just lift the seat out of the swing to carry him with you to different rooms in your home.It's So Lovely!A baby swing is not small -- it's basically a piece of furniture. So we're delighted to find that the Zen Collection swing offers a contemporary and sophisticated palette that can complement your home's d&eacute;cor without making your house look like one big nursery. You won't find any frills or pastel colors here. Its contemporary pattern features sprays of leaves and dragonfly silhouettes in stylish tones of cream, chocolate brown, and moss green with ruby-red accents.Its lovely textural touches include wood-finished handles, satin accents, and embroidered detailing on the cover, as well as on the mobile toys, which are cute and stylish. The toys include two plush dragonflies and a plush turtle, topped with matching umbrellas. It stands on a sturdy, dark brown, metal frame that's heavy enough to provide good support and security. Not only is this swing good looking, it also makes a great choice for unisex decorating.Easy Assembly, Sturdy ConstructionThe swing took us less than half an hour to assemble and required only a Phillips screwdriver. One minor problem: we had to re-thread the mobile so it could hang properly. The assembled swing has a 26-by-33-inch footprint and stands 47 inches tall with the mobile attached, so it takes up quite a bit of room. This is something to consider if you have limited living space. However, the base folds together easily, so you can lean it against a wall when it's not in use.What's in the BoxRemovable infant seat, mobile, swing motor, swing frame components for assembly.",Fisher-Price Zen Collection Cradle Swing,160.79,Fisher-Price,,1364

Two microfiber inserts, one small and one large, come with this diaper to make it complete.

Our One Size Diapers are made in solid colors and the ever popular Cow Hide print. 

The Cow Hide print is made of the same material as the solid colors so it is tested to last up to 12 hours with absolutely no wicking for most babies.

The One Size Diapers will still feature custom milled fleece. No leg casings, which make better fitting diapers and contain messes better, leaving NO red marks. We often get the question: Should the fleece roll out? Yes it should roll out. Do NOT try to roll the fleece in. This will cause wicking if you try this. Our One Size Reusable Diapers are made to have the fleece roll out so the only thing that touches your child's delicate skin is the soft fleece",Happy Heiny's One Size Cloth Diapers (Light Pink),17.95,,,1442

Every mother is unique so, naturally, the way our bodies metabolize alcohol is unique, too. Metabolizing alcohol depends on several factors including body weight, type of alcohol consumed, and food intake so milkscreen was created to eliminate those variables. milkscreen also helps ensure that the alcohol concentrated in Moms breast milk is not at a level that may have negative impacts on Baby. Studies have shown infants consuming breast milk with alcohol concentrations at approximately 30mg/dl, or 0.03%, and higher have exhibited distinctive changes in feeding behavior and sleep. Babies consume less if the milk contains alcohol and they also sleep less and wake more frequently.

1552,B0019LWEOY,[['Baby']],"CozyWedge is a simpler, safer crib bumper with a modern, low profile. Traditional padded bumpers are a hassle to use and studies have shown they can pose a safety risk to young babies. CozyWedge helps address these concerns, and has a fresh, clean design to accent any nursery decor. CozyWedge is made of hard foam inserts in a washable, organic cotton slipcover. It goes around the perimeter of the crib, tying in just six places to stay securely in place. To change the sheets, just untie one side and the whole bumper lifts out for total access to baby's bedding. If baby makes a big mess, the slipcover is machine washable. CozyWedge's unique shape means the pacifier will almost never slip onto the floor in the middle of the night -- so everyone gets a better night's sleep. Many parents like having some kids of bumper in the crib even though studies show traditional bumper pads are not necessary for baby's safety and even present some risks to infants. CozyWedge offers parents an alternative, with a firm surface that won't form a soft pocket around baby's mouth and nose. The low profile helps protect tiny arms and legs from entanglement while allowing far greater visibility into the crib. Experts increasingly recommend frequent checks to see if baby is okay; CozyWedge makes that easy. And because CozyWedge is extremely lightweight, it won't press down on a baby who gets under the bumper.",Inspired Ideas BABY CozyWedge Crib Bumper in Blue,28.0,,,1552

1615,B001C1J3VS,[['Baby']],"For over two decades i play., Inc. has been researching children's health issues to make safer feeding accessories that come in contact with babies' mouths and foods. Due to recent safety issues in children's toys we saw a need for toys free from potentially harmful toxins. So in 2008 we launched a new line of PVC, phthalate, BPA and nitrosamine free toys. Inside Baby: Pregnancy and early childhood are critical times in babies' lives because they are growing and developing so rapidly. During this time they are vulnerable to elements in their environment, and parents should protect them as much as possible from exposure to potentially harmful substances. The first priority for growing babies is to make sure everything babies put inside their mouth is healthy, safe and promotes the development of strong immune system.  &#x2022; PVC free and Phthalate free: PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) is a hard plastic that requires harsh chemical softeners, such as phthalates, to make it appropriate for use in soft plastic baby toys such as squirty toys. In 2003 we discovered that phthalates were shown to disrupt reproductive functions and cause other developmental problems, so we launched a line of toys free from PVC and phthalates.  &#x2022; BPA free: Bisphenol-A (BPA) is used in hard, clear plastics sometimes used in baby toys to prevent breakage. In 2006 we learned that BPA also disrupts reproductive functions and causes other developmental problems, so we added a line of BPA free toys to our line. &#x2022; Nitrosamine free: Nitrosamines are found in latex products such as some infant teethers. They have been shown to cause cancer in many animals, so all our teethers and soothers are nitrosamine free.",green sprouts Organic Velour Blankie Animal-Rose Bunny,10.89,GREEN SPROUTS,,1615

The Snappi is a safer, more reliable, EASY to use fastener for cloth diapers that replaces the nasty diaper pins. The stretchable non-toxic Snappi hooks into the diaper material to make a strong closure. They work best with diapers that have a loose enough weave for the Snappi to hook into. (Snappi terry cloth diapers, cotton pre-folds, and others) Note they do not work well with flannel or other tightly woven diapers.

How to use your Snappi:

To improve elasticity, stretch your Snappi fastener a few times before use.

Step 1: Hook left

Step 2: Stretch across and hook right

Step 3: Stretch down and hook center

The Snappi should go from a ""T"" shape to a ""Y"" shape when stretched properly.

Warning: Always use a cover over a Snappi fastener. Keep out of children's reach when not in use. Do not use a Snappi fastener on toddlers that have the ability to undo or take off their cover/diaper/clothes. Do not use your Snappi for longer than 6 months. Not UV resistant - exposure to the sun can reduce the effectiveness of the Snappi.

CAUTION: Any tear in the Snappi can lead to separation of a piece, presenting a possible choking hazard. Inspect the Snappi before each use and discontinue using immediately if there is any sign of cracking, tearing, breakage or wear of the teeth or any other parts. Do not cut a Snappi as this may cause tearing.",Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Mint color mix),12.99,,,1698

The slender bottles allow a sure grip for even the tiniest hands and caregivers can comfortably hold the bottle while feeding.Patented Venting System to Reduce GasMicro-channel vents placed on the bottom of the bottle, instead of slits on the nipple, provide a consistent flow of liquid. Air enters and exits the bottle without mixing with the milk, greatly reducing gas, colic, and messy spit-ups, while also minimizing pressure on your baby's ear canals. The BPA- and Phthalate-free bottle comes in a variety of sizes so your baby can grow with the VentAire system.Easy Cleanup and Convenient, Pre-Calibrated BottlesFor added convenience, the VentAire bottles open at both ends for easy cleaning. The bottles, bottle caps, vent disks, and nipples are safe to wash on the top rack of the dishwasher or can be rinsed with hot, soapy water. Plus, the bottles feature convenient, pre-calibrated markers, so you never have to guess at how much liquid you are giving your baby at each feeding.About Playtex: Thoughtfully Designed Products for Your Little OnesThe Playtex family of baby and toddler products provides invaluable, time-saving products for parents and caregivers.

1860,B001KQFYBS,[['Baby']],"For over two decades i play., Inc. has been researching children's health issues to make safer feeding accessories that come in contact with babies' mouths and foods. Due to recent safety issues in children's toys we saw a need for toys free from potentially harmful toxins. So in 2008 we launched a new line of PVC, phthalate, BPA and nitrosamine free toys made from synthetic materials. Inside Baby: Pregnancy and early childhood are critical times in babies' lives because they are growing and developing so rapidly. During this time they are vulnerable to elements in their environment, and parents should protect them as much as possible from exposure to potentially harmful substances. The first priority for growing babies is to make sure everything babies put inside their mouth is healthy, safe and promotes the development of strong immune system.  &#x2022; PVC free and Phthalate free: PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) is a hard plastic that requires harsh chemical softeners, such as phthalates, to make it appropriate for use in soft plastic baby toys such as squirty toys. In 2003 we discovered that phthalates were shown to disrupt reproductive functions and cause other developmental problems, so we launched a line of toys free from PVC and phthalates.  &#x2022; BPA free: Bisphenol-A (BPA) is used in hard, clear plastics sometimes used in baby toys to prevent breakage. In 2006 we learned that BPA also disrupts reproductive functions and causes other developmental problems, so we added a line of BPA free toys to our line. &#x2022; Nitrosamine free: Nitrosamines are found in latex products such as some infant teethers. They have been shown to cause cancer in many animals, so all our teethers and soothers are nitrosamine free.",green sprouts Natural Wood Ring Rattle,12.97,,,1860

1875,B001KZPZCW,[['Baby']],"This double-knit wool diaper cover is made from lovely, soft organic wool that is ideal for even the smallest babies with sensitive skin.  An excellent alternative to synthetic covers, wool soakers are naturally antibacterial and provide excellent moisture regulation.  Wool wicks moisture away from the skin and can absorb up to one third of its weight in moisture and return it to the environment. Once it is prepped and ready for use, you will have no leaks at all with this wool cover, making it an excellent choice for night time.       

These covers can be used over any pre-fold or fitted cloth diaper, and the high knitted waistband provides a nice fit over any type of diaper, no matter how bulky or high-fitting the diaper is.  This soft ribbed waist band also keeps your baby's tummy and back warm and cozy throughout the night.  The thick double-knit wool is perfect for night time use.  Disana wool covers are wonderful for night time and once properly prepared (washed and lanolized), your baby should never have leak while wearing this cover.  

Size/ Fit: These covers will shrink a bit after washing, so it's not a bad idea to size up.  The style of these covers are similar to our Engel double-knit nappy covers but have a slightly different shape. The legs on disana covers are a bit more snug than the Engel covers, which is nice for containing leaks, but do keep this in mind if your baby has chunkier legs.",Disana Organic Merino Wool Cover-Natural-86/92 (12-24 mo),26.95,Disana,,1875

2065,B001T8QIVW,[['Baby']],"RLR Laundry Treatment is one of the best and easiest product used to strip your cloth diapers. It gets the extra detergent and build up OUT of your cloth diapers!! It's not a soap or detergent, it's a laundry treatment. During a regular wash, mineral deposits, soil sediment and residual matter from detergent can all accumulate in your fabrics causing it to look dingy. Using RLR removes that build-up, leaving whites whiter and colors brighter without using bleach or bluing agents. RLR Laundry Treatment works by removing these particles from the clothing, holding them in suspension in the water and preventing them from redepositing so they rinse away &amp; leave fabric looking like new. We recommend using RLR Laundry Treatment as a preventative every 30-60 days or when a problem with leaks or smelly diapers occur. Directions for stripping your cloth diapers: Fill washer to highest setting with warm water, add 1 packet of RLR for top loaders or 1/2 packet for front loaders. Next add up to 60 diaper items (30 inserts, 30 diapers or 20 diapers 40 inserts etc.) Soak for 30 minutes and then run a normal wash cycle. Rinse &amp; spin twice, hang dry diaper shells &amp; dry your inserts in the dryer. RLR Laundry Treatment contains no dyes, perfumes or phosphates, is completely bio-degradable and non-polluting.",RLR Laundry Treatment and Cloth Diaper Stripper,2.46,Cadie,,2065

2125,B001XOVF3I,[['Baby']],"Dr. Brown's bottle features a patented two-piece internal vent system that works unlike any other bottle design. The vent system fully vents our bottle for vacuum free feeding, which we call positive-pressure flow, similar to breastfeeding. As the baby feeds, air is channeled from the nipple collar through the vent system, bypassing the breast milk or formula, to the back of the bottle. Air never mixes with the breast milk or formula which minimizes oxidation and helps maintain essential nutrients like vitamins C, A and E. Babies feed more comfortably because the vent system allows them to nurse without fighting the negative effects of a vacuum or the discomfort of ingesting air bubbles. This helps to reduce feeding problems like colic, spit-up, burping, and gas. The breast milk or formula flows freely, without nipple collapse. Includes two&#xA0;4 ounce glass bottles with two level one nipples, two 2 piece internal vents and one nipple cleaning brush.

The seat's side impact protection features include aluminum-reinforced sides and energy-absorbing EPS foam, which work together to protect the child's head and body and provide a thorough, superior level of protection. The XTSL stands out as the only Radian model to include aluminum reinforced head support with adjustable head wings, which enhances safety and provides support for sleeping children.For added safety, the seat is also equipped with a forward- and rear-facing tether system and is the only car seat in the market to offer SafeStop technology, an energy-absorbing harness system.Easy Installation, Portability, and ConvenienceLike many car seats, the Radian allows you to easily install it by engaging the seat's Latch connectors onto a vehicle's Latch bars, which can be found in vehicles built after 2001. For drivers of vehicles without Latch, the good news is that the seat can also be easily installed with the vehicle seatbelt. For cars with Latch, the seat's SuperLATCH system is a prominent feature that offers added convenience and increased safety.What makes the Radian XTSL different? Typical Latch systems have limited weight capacities of 40-48 pounds. Once a child has reached this weight limit, instructions call for the caregiver to unlatch the seat and reinstall it using the car's seatbelt, a method that increases the likelihood of incorrect installations. The XTSL's SuperLATCH system extends that weight limit to 80 pounds. Beyond the added convenience, SuperLATCH also helps increase safety, as a Latch system is an easier installation method with less room for error than using the seatbelt method. Further easing installation is an Easy-Tite adjuster for firm fastening and rubber non-slip grips along the seat bottom to prevent car seat slippage.Because safety is a priority to Sunshine Kids, the Radian not only meets and exceeds US mandated standards, but has also been tested to the more rigorous, yet voluntary NCAP standard which simulates more severe accidents.Of particular convenience to daycare providers and parents of multiple children, the Radian's slim design fits three across in most vehicles, making it ideal for sedans and smaller SUVs. Plus, it still provides ample shoulder room for growing children.

Trusted by UK parents since 2000, Steri-bottle is the safe and simple way to feed your baby anytime, at home, or on the move. Steri-bottle is 100% BPA-free and phthalate-free, and is 100% recyclable. Steri-bottle is designed with care in the U.K. and made with pride in the USA. Each package contains 5 or 10 complete bottles and nipples. Steri-bottle is pre-sterilized and ready to use out of the box because the bottles and nipples are manufactured at high heat in a clean-room facility in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. No human hands touch the sterile bottles and nipples - the manufacturing and packaging process is automated. Use Steri-bottle when traveling. You used to pack an extra bag with clean bottles, nipples, brushes, and maybe even a sterilizing kit. You used to stay up late washing bottles when everyone else was asleep. Now, just open the Steri-bottle package, remove one pre-sterilized bottle and nipple. They're ready to use. Fill the bottle, warm it up, close the lid, and feed your child. When you're done, you can recycle the entire Steri-bottle. Use Steri-bottle at home. It's 3 a.m. &#x2013; it's time for a routine feed. Suddenly, you realize that there are no sterilized bottles in the cupboard. And you have to be at work in the morning and desperately want a few more minutes of sleep. There's no need to spend up to 10 minutes or more washing used bottles while half-asleep. Now you can just reach for a Steri-bottle. Open the box, take out a pre-sterilized bottle and nipple. Fill, close, and feed. This has taken you 10-15 seconds. Steri-bottle has been feeding babies and saving U.K. Moms and dads thousands and thousands of hours of bottle washing and sterilizing. When you can enjoy a few more moments, or go back to sleep faster, you will see why we say that Steri-bottle saves you time and more.","Steribottle Ready to Use Disposable Baby Bottles,  10-Count",10.99,Steri-Bottle,,2530

Each diaper weighs 2.6 oz, 25% heavier and thus more absorbent than any brands found in chain stores that we have sampled. The material in our diapers is also much softer than you find in chain stores. The Unbleached version (also available) is not available in stores and is even softer than the bleached.

This is the original cloth diaper still used in many countries. These are a one size fits all diaper that requires folding to properly fit baby. This diapers also make great inserts for pocket diapers and are useful for other purposes such as dish towels, cleanups, burp cloths , lap pads, changing pads, bibs, wash cloths and baby wipers. These diapers are also used as optical cleaning cloths, CD & record cleaning cloths and for shoe shine polishing rags. Because these diapers are only one layer thick they dry quickly on your cloths line or in your dryer. Used with pins and plastic pants or into your diaper covers or use inside a pocket diaper.

2718,B002VPCQTA,[['Baby']],"Easy Stroll works on most strollers that have standard handles with rubber or foam hand grips. Easy Stroll does not work with umbrella type stroller handles, pistol grip handles, or strollers with hard plastic hand grips. One hand operation of a stroller is now possible with Easy Stroll. Previously, pushing a stroller with one hand was cumbersome at best. And, if you were successful, it usually resulted in a sore arm or a sore back for days. Now, all of that has changed. With Easy Stroll, there is little need to use arm or back strength at all. Instead, leverage does the work for you. Simply change the direction you're walking and the stroller will effortlessly change a directions with you. To turn the stroller to the right, walk slightly to the left. The leverage of your entire body will easily turn the stroller to the right. Some of the control still comes from your arms, but most of the control comes from moving your feet. After a short period of time, the operation of the stroller becomes second nature and your strolling will never be the same. In addition to the control it provides, easy stroll is an ergonomic stroller handle that promotes proper posture. Baby strollers without Easy Stroll, require two hands for operation. This in turn requires ""hunching"" over the stroller, which puts an unnatural curve in your spine. Unfortunately, these improper body mechanics are unavoidable when pushing a stroller with two hands. Using single handed operation, Easy Stroll straightens your back and allows for a ""normal"" walking posture when pushing a stroller. As a result, the operator experiences no arm or back strain.","Easy Stroll One Handed Stroller Grip, Black",27.95,Easy Stroll,,2718

All of this means you never have to spend time trying to figure out how to correctly rethread or adjust the harness. Does your child ever make a little mess with their animal crackers in the car? The combination of our no-rethread harness and our easy-off padding makes clean up a snap, literally, our pad snaps right off. Simply lift the center flap on the pad, unsnap the sides and clean up is as simple as can be. Once your pad is clean, it snaps back on in seconds hassle free!As your child grows, have no worries that they will not fit in your True Fit. The interior dimensions of our seat are large and comfortable. In fact, with the extra cushy seat pads and roomier seat it may be hard to convince your child to leave their seat!When you are ready to choose your favorite True Fit model, let us help you decide.True Fit is the only car seat manufacturer with the removable head rest for rear facing installation. By removing the top portion adults in the driver position have more legroom than what is available using competitive convertible car seats.Another huge feature is the external adjustment of the harness. Virtually all other manufacturers require you to rethread their harness in order to make adjustments. Utilizing an external adjustment simplifies the process and assures you of proper installation.The external measurements for our seat are comparable to all other major competitors. The big difference lies in the internal dimensions where we are wider and deeper allowing the child to better fit in the seat ergonomically for a longer life cycle. Another big issue is cushioning where the child sits as our seats offer more padding in all areas of contact.We now offer external mounted latch (C650 and C670 models) making for easy installation for those using this method of installation.It may be trivial but we are the only manufacturer whose cup holders are level when the seat is installed in the car. All other brands incorporating cup holders are level only in the store.For a full list of the True Fit Rebound C670 features see below:Removable headrest allows for better rear facing installationCan be used rear facing with headrest for infants from 5 to 35 lbs. with Rebound Energy Management SystemEasy-to-read center angle indicator with two position settingsEasy-to-adjust no-rethread harness for use to 65 lbs.Multi-position crotch strap adjustmentEasy-off pads snap on and off without rethreading harnessColor-coded belt paths for easy installationBuilt-in lock-offs for both rear and forward facing installationExternal LATCH systemTwo-position recline for better installationDeep side wings, side impact tested to international standardsFor use with children from 5 to 65 lbs., or up to 50 inches tallWhat's in the BoxTrue Fit Rebound C670 Convertible Car Seat and instruction manual.Click to view a 360&#xB0; Spin.",The First Years True Fit C670 Premier Convertible Car Seat,192.0,,,2745

This is a huge savings over the cost of regular diapers. Plus, your child will never have any harsh chemicals touching their skin. Many mothers get overwhelmed when deciding on what brand of cloth diapers to buy, but LOOK NO FURTHER! The Mother-ease diaper system consists of three components: a fitted cloth diaper, an absorbent liner for additional protection at night or whenever needed, and a breathable, waterproof diaper cover worn over the diaper. These products can be purchased individually or in packages. Finally! A leak-proof cloth diaper cover that refuses to compromise breathability! We searched for over a year to find just the right fabric that would meet our quality standards. The fabric needed to be soft, durable and waterproof. The Air Flow Snap Cover, with adjustable snaps at the waist and leg openings has an air ventilation system between the snaps. This allows for maximum air circulation as baby moves, reducing the risk of bacteria by keeping the temperature inside the cloth diaper down.

The Snappi is a safer, more reliable, EASY to use fastener for cloth diapers that replaces the nasty diaper pins. The stretchable non-toxic Snappi hooks into the diaper material to make a strong closure. They work best with diapers that have a loose enough weave for the Snappi to hook into. (Snappi terry cloth diapers, cotton pre-folds, and others) Note they do not work well with flannel or other tightly woven diapers.

How to use your Snappi:

To improve elasticity, stretch your Snappi fastener a few times before use.

Step 1: Hook left

Step 2: Stretch across and hook right

Step 3: Stretch down and hook center

The Snappi should go from a ""T"" shape to a ""Y"" shape when stretched properly.

Warning: Always use a cover over a Snappi fastener. Keep out of children's reach when not in use. Do not use a Snappi fastener on toddlers that have the ability to undo or take off their cover/diaper/clothes. Do not use your Snappi for longer than 6 months. Not UV resistant - exposure to the sun can reduce the effectiveness of the Snappi.

CAUTION: Any tear in the Snappi can lead to separation of a piece, presenting a possible choking hazard. Inspect the Snappi before each use and discontinue using immediately if there is any sign of cracking, tearing, breakage or wear of the teeth or any other parts. Do not cut a Snappi as this may cause tearing.","Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Light Blue, Bright Blue, White)",14.45,,,2837

It is compact and sleek and it comes in four attractive colours, blue, pink, purple and white. Parents love Pourty because it is easy to empty and clean. Whenever you empty a basic potty you have to empty the contents over the seating area and any pee dribbles down the outside of the potty and all over the place. In contrast to this, the Pourty potty has a handle at the front making it easy to pick up your child's potty and pour the contents out of the back away from where the child sits or touches. The lip at the top of the duct is designed so that there should be no dribbles down the outside of the Pourty. You can then simply refill the Pourty with water and wash it out. It is very comfortable for the child to sit on because the seating area is wide and ergonomically designed. The two sides of the back rest offer ample support. It is made out of thick sturdy plastic making it harder for your child to knock over. It is stable to sit on which gives the child confidence when toilet training. The Pourty is bigger than most one piece potties but smaller than some two piece potties. Children from 6 months to 4 years old find it comfortable to sit on and are in a good healthy position to go to the toilet. Doctors agree that adopting the squatting position is the healthiest way to have a bowel movement.

The Snappi is a safer, more reliable, EASY to use fastener for cloth diapers that replaces the nasty diaper pins. The stretchable non-toxic Snappi hooks into the diaper material to make a strong closure. They work best with diapers that have a loose enough weave for the Snappi to hook into. (terry cloth diapers, cotton pre-folds, and others) They do not work well with flannel or other tightly woven diapers.

The TODDLER SIZE is better suited for larger babies and young toddlers. It is longer across the top 'T' of the Snappi. Once stretched correctly, the Snappi fastener gives an additonal 4"" stretch across the width than the Size 1 Snappi. It comfortably fits up to a 30"" waist. 

AGE RECOMMENDATION: Although this depends largely on the size and shape of the baby or toddler, we recommend using the Size 2 Snappi for children aged 16 months+ 

WARNING: Do NOT use a Snappi fastener on toddlers who have the ability to undo their cover and take off their diaper and/or clothes. 

How to use your Snappi:

To improve elasticity, stretch your Snappi fastener a few times before use.

Step 1: Hook left

Step 2: Stretch across and hook right

Step 3: Stretch down and hook center

The Snappi should go from a ""T"" shape to a ""Y"" shape when stretched properly.

Warning: Always use a cover over a Snappi fastener. Keep out of children's reach when not in use. Do not use a Snappi fastener on toddlers that have the ability to undo or take off their cover/diaper/clothes. Do not use your Snappi for longer than 6 months. Not UV resistant - exposure to the sun can reduce the effectiveness of the Snappi.

CAUTION: Any tear in the Snappi can lead to separation of a piece, presenting a possible choking hazard. Inspect the Snappi before each use and discontinue using immediately if there is any sign of cracking, tearing, breakage or wear of the teeth or any other parts. Do not cut a Snappi as this may cause tearing.","Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Toddler Size 2 - Pack of 2 (Mint Green, White)",7.25,snappi,,3034

Prefold cloth diapers are popular for their affordability and are the most common diaper supplied by cloth diaper services. Though they don't share all the bells and whistles as other more modern cloth diapers, they have their definite and permanent place in the industry and they have been proven dependable and economical. However, Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefolds are no ordinary prefold. We've solved many of the cons of prefold diapers in our patent-pending design. Ordinary prefolds are bulky and take a long time to dry. When hung to dry, they can become stiff and crunchy. In addition, most prefolds are 8 layers thick in the middle, which makes it difficult to clean all layers of the diaper thoroughly. Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefolds are designed to allow air flow and each panel is only 2 layers thick which allows for thorough cleansing with little effort and quick drying times. Our custom hemp jersey is as soft as your favorite t-shirt and it knitted with love right here in the USA.

It's the best of both worlds! No assembly required! This innovative diaper has a fold-out liner, which makes it very easy to stuff. But don't worry about unstuffing - the agitation in your washing machine will work the liner out of the pocket, so there's no need to get your hands dirty! The liner is made of three layers of soft minky fabric: it absorbs quickly, and it absorbs a LOT. The liner can be folded to create more layers where more absorption is needed, or to reduce bulk if desired. Bonus: minky dries VERY quickly, so after the wash is done, these diapers will be back on baby's bum in no time. This is a diaper engineered for successful leak containment and total convenience. With a wider elastic in the back and a stretchy waist, the New Easy Fit offers great protection, and a super comfy fit too. The New Easy Fit is colour-coordinated for a sleeker look. Snaps, hook and loop, thread and minky are dyed to match the outer fabric - proof that cloth diapers are more fun and fashion-forward than ever!

3357,B003U9V18S,[['Baby']],"The Joovy Nook is amazing. First of all, it looks fantastic. It has clean lines and is unobtrusive in my kitchen. I was fearful that I would not be able to keep its beautiful white leatherette so white after strawberries and tomato sauce but tada it's still white. It wipes down easily and on occasion you can take the entire seat cover off and put it in the washer and dryer. A leatherette, really. The tapestry fabric in Orangie and Greenie are also washable. When I say unobtrusive, I mean it. It folds completely flat with one hand. Many high chairs fold, but I have never seen one that folds this flat, this easily. But the best thing about it is when my 18 month old walks over to it, swings the tray open and attempts to climb in. The swing open tray is awesome. In the past, that was always a HUGE problem for me, where to put the tray. Many high chairs claim to have places to store the tray but it is always a cumbersome project to get the tray stowed away. The Nook's swing open tray makes it easy to store the tray and to put your child in and out of the high chair when holding your child, you step on the front leg cross bar, press the button under the right side of the tray and swing it open, put him/her in. It is simple and easy, no more needing to remove the tray and find a spot to set it down. Plus, the tray has a removable tray on top that can be easily popped off and rinsed after a messy meal (it's dishwasher safe too). The top tray is a lifesaver, making food disappear before it makes the transition from eating to wearing, instantly leaving a clean tray for a book, toy or clean second course. This small feature can extend quality time at dinner time. The top and bottom tray are easily removed for cleaning as needed. In the daily grind of motherhood, it's the little things that are so great. It's so nice when a product performs and helps to simply your life.","Joovy Nook Highchair, White Leatherette",119.84,Joovy,,3357

Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream.  This necklace looks great when paired with a teething bracelet.

Baltic amber necklaces are made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

The seat and canopy are super durable 600D fabric (just like our other strollers), and it includes the same adjustable and light reflective 5-point harness, huge Joovy canopy, cup holder and zippered pocket for parents. The basket is absolutely giant compared to other strollers in this price range with incredibly easy access. You will love the one hand recline system that locks in infinite positions all the way down to 149&#xB0;,  for a near flat napping position. The bumper bar also can be used as a car seat adapter for all Graco infant car seats. All six wheels have sealed bearings for great handling and easy pushing. The Scooter has world class looks, great functionality, and high quality components, making it the best value available in single strollers today.",Joovy Scooter Single Stroller Greenie,144.7,,,3552

3596,B0046QDV32,[['Baby']],"The Joovy Room2 Ultralight takes all of the popular features of our Room2 playard and eliminates the only complaint we've ever gotten on the Room2 (too heavy). At just over 21 pounds, it's over 30% lighter than the Room2. The Ultralight is 90% as big as the Room2 (it's 9 square feet vs. 10 square feet). The difference is due to the tapered design of the side rails; the top rails are 4 "" shorter than the bottom rails. This design significantly increases the difficulty of climbing out of the playard and makes the Room2 Ultralight super stable. The fact that the Ultralight uses the ground as its floorboard decreases the weight and increases stability too. It has an awesome, super comfortable memory foam mattress and a Joovy 100% brushed cotton sheet (very popular feature). The Ultralight has two easy folding features, it can be quickly folded in half or super compact for travel. When folded in half, it takes up only 3.5 square feet of storage space you can put it next to the wall, underneath the bed, behind the door or in a closet and it unsnaps back to full size in seconds. The Ultralight is perfect for travel; it folds into a compact size and fits right into the travel bag (included). Another clever feature is a solid 600D side panel instead of mesh; it acts as a protective curtain against wind, light and noise on one side of the playard. Positioned properly this can be a huge feature at nap/bed time. There's a large pocket on the outer side it's great for storing all of the essentials. The playard and travel bag are made of durable 600D fabric. Joovy's Room2 playards are the biggest, most durable playards on the market today. The fitted cotton sheet adds a level of comfort un-matched in the industry. Now you can have all that and more in a lighter weight, better looking playard that outperforms everything else.",Joovy Room2 Ultralight Playard Black,127.49,,,3596

Its unique functionality allows it to be used as a head support or neck support by attaching or detaching the two arms. The two arms can be attached to make a head support by overlapping the ends of the right arm (Velcro arm) and the left arm. The Velcro under the right arm sticks to the white portion on the upper side of the left arm to create a secure attachment which prevents the head from falling through the opening. The circular opening of the pod cradles the back of the head while providing comfortable placement and optimal positioning. The length of the white portion allows the pod to be adjusted to various sizes.  Neck Support - Recommended for 6 Months to 12 Months. Once the two arms are detached, the Velcro should be covered with the Peak-a-Boo cover located on the upper side of the right arm. The Peak-a-Boo cover is the self-fabric flap which should be turned inside out to hide the Velcro in order to avoid irritation to the skin.

BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? 
The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. 

Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream.
 Parent supervision is recommended at all times. 
They are 12-12.5 in. 
Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch.

Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in.

Its unique functionality allows it to be used as a head support or neck support by attaching or detaching the two arms. Pillow dimensions: 3.9 x 3.9 x 1.2 cm. Pillow covers are either minky soft 100% polyester or 100% cotton, depending on the fabric design. Head Support - The two arms can be attached to make a head support by overlapping the ends of the right arm (Velcro arm) and the left arm. The Velcro under the right arm sticks to the white portion on the upper side of the left arm to create a secure attachment which prevents the head from falling through the opening. The circular opening of the pillow cradles the back of the head while providing comfortable placement and optimal positioning. The length of the white portion allows the pillow to be adjusted to various sizes. Recommended for 0-6 months. Neck Support - Recommended for 6 to 12 Months. Once the two arms are detached, the Velcro should be covered with the Peak-a-Boo cover located on the upper side of the right arm. The Peak-a-Boo cover is the self-fabric flap which should be turned inside out to hide the Velcro in order to avoid irritation to the skin. Babymoon Pillow has been tested under a reasonable program of testing (including testing by a certified third-party laboratory where required) and the Babymoon Pillow complies with all Federal and state consumer product safety rules, bans, standards or regulations applicable to the Babymoon Pillow. ***The Babymoon pillow should not be used as a head support or pillow to sleep on for any infant over 6 months of age or for any infant that can roll over from back to front, as this may cause a suffocation hazard.",Babymoon Pillow - For Flat Head Syndrome &amp; Neck Support (Pistachio Stripe),24.5,,,3811

Baltic amber necklaces are made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in.

4155,B004S6W2GC,[['Baby']],"Parking lots can be dangerous, even fatal, for children. Protect your little loved ones with a colorful aid that keeps them near to you and far from moving vehicles.
WHY IS IT NEEDED:
Parents, grandparents, day-care providers, aunts, uncles, friends, or whoever is caring for a child can be easily distracted in parking lots. Loading or unloading packages, rifling for keys, tending to the baby, or helping elderly parents can take precious attention away from our children, leaving them vulnerable to a number of dangerous situations. Other drivers can't see when they back up because the car next to them is too large or they're distracted by their cell phones, or blind spots make it easy for them to overlook small children who may be behind them. And children, well, they don't always do what they're told or stay where they should. It only takes one second for tragedy to strike. 

HOW IT WORKS:
Place the Parking Pal on the side of your vehicle, where it will remain safely attached at all times. It was specifically designed with bright colors, playful illustrations, and a small palm children love to place their hands on. After a couple learning sessions, your child will discover that the Parking Pal is their safe spot, and they will know where to go the second they are outside the car. It also helps teach them that parking lots are no place to play.",Parking Pal Car Magnet - Parking Lot Safety for Children (Flower Pal),8.99,,,4155

4232,B004XV11D2,[['Baby']],"When we introduced the thinkbaby over 4 years ago 95% of the baby bottles on the market were made of polycarbonate which contains BPA. Initially, we attempted to convince the major companies to move off of polycarbonate, but after being unsuccessful we launched thinkbaby and thinksport to address the concern of chemicals leaching from consumer products. We started with the baby bottle because polycarbonate was ubiquitous across the industry. As little ones systems are still in a state of development they have very little defense against foreign chemicals. While many companies have emerged to offer BPA free baby bottles, many bottles not only still contain BPA despite saying BPA free (see Health Canada study), but many companies have also landed on untested materials just because the material claims to be free of BPA. thinkbaby utilizes the precautionary principle in the creation of all of our products. The top of the bottle features a easy to close cover to keep it from coming into contact with foreign substances.

4234,B004Y3DWYK,[['Baby']],"The Joovy Tricycoo is a tricycle for children as young as 18 months. The Tricycoo is the perfect way to introduce your child to balance and coordination, one step at a time. Your child will love the adventure of piloting their very first vehicle and parents love that they are in control while their child masters each stage of learning. The concept of the Tricycoo is simple - your child does not need to steer, pedal or balance on their own.  They simply enjoy the fun and independence of their first tricycle while you guide them with the parent push handle (removable).  When engaged, the parent push handle overrides the steering on the Tricycoo. It has 4-positions and is adjustable from 32.5"" to 38"" high. While your child is getting used to the idea of balancing and holding on to the handlebars, the front wheel pedals can be unlocked; this allows the pedals to spin freely without force and ""go"" without the need to pedal. The removable 'baby surround arms' safely enclose your child on the seat and the fold down footrest gives more stability to the child when riding. This gives them confidence and support while they perfect their balancing. The Joovy Tricycoo is first class all the way - unlike most tricycles with blow-molded wheels, the Tricycoo sports injection-molded wheels with urethane treads. Parents love these wheels because they roll quietly on most floors. For additional fun, the Tricycoo is equipped with a bell on the handlebar and a large rear basket for take-along play. The Tricycoo frame is constructed of steel and it supports a child up to 44 pounds. When your child masters the first phase on the Tricycoo, you'll be ready to remove the parent push handle, 'baby surround arms' and fold up the footrest. The front wheel pedals can be locked to allow the child to pedal using their own power. Now you can smile and watch as your child pilots their Tricycoo all by themselves. Assembly is required.","Joovy Tricycoo Tricycle, Greenie",179.99,Joovy,,4234

How to use your Snappi:

To improve elasticity, stretch your Snappi fastener a few times before use.

Step 3: Stretch down and hook center

The Snappi should go from a ""T"" shape to a ""Y"" shape when stretched properly.

Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in.

Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. Parent supervision is recommended at all times. They are 12-12.5 in. Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

2) The kit has everything you need, and nothing you don't. After 20 + years of late night calls from frantic parents, we at Doc To Go know that a bright penlight, a washable nasal aspirator that can hold suction and strong tongue depressor are worth their weight in gold for mouth/nose/throat/ear inspections, or that sterile latex gloves and non-sting antiseptics are a MUST when taking care of the umbilical cord bump on your newborn.

4485,B005G1WKEW,[['Baby']],"Bottle Buddy is a unique electronic formula dispensing product that accurately counts a pre-set amount of powdered infant and follow on formula into a baby's bottle. Using Bottle Buddy to make up a feeding is convenient, quick and easy to use and, most importantly, it saves time and ensures that every bottle contains the right amount of formula every time. It&#x2019;s a common, yet annoying, mistake to make: you're preparing a bottle for your baby and counting the amount of powder into the bottle when someone or something interrupts you. Before you know it, you&#x2019;re wondering: &#x201C;was that five or six scoops?&#x201D; and have to start over again. Bottle Buddy eliminates the risk of contamination, human error and spillage by delivering an adjustable, preset, consistent quantity of powder at a touch of a button. Bottle Buddy is ideal for new parents or caretakers who may be nervous about formula quantities. Bottle Buddy is set to revolutionize the way parents make up their babies' bottles forever. Benefits Breast milk is generally thought to be best for babies but there are a number of good reasons why many mothers choose to bottle feed from birth or only breast feed for a short while. Some parents supplement breast milk with powdered infant or follow-on formula - especially as the baby gets older. Whatever they choose, all parents want to see their baby thrive and grow at a healthy rate. On average, parents put over 10,000 scoops of infant or follow-on formula into bottles in the first year of a baby&#x2019;s life. It is not only very time consuming but also very easy to miscount the amount of formula used, especially when holding a crying, hungry baby and trying to make up a bottle at the same time. Using Bottle Buddy to make up a feeding ensures that every bottle contains the correct amount of formula and overcomes some of the serious health risks associated with formula feeding. Miscounting scoops, overfeeding or underfeeding on a regular basis can have long-term health implications.","Baby Buddy Bottle Buddy The Electronic Formula Dispenser, White",114.89,Baby Buddy,,4485

It is the first and only warmer designed specifically to follow all guidelines set forth by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) to safely thaw and warm breastmilk using warm, flowing water. Patent pending SAFEHeatTM technology allows high-speed warming using a low temperature, nutrient-safe water bath that is safe for breastmilk, with a built in timer to eliminate the risk of overheating. The result is a warmer that is safer, more precise, faster and easier to use than conventional warmers which use high temperature steam that can be damaging to the antibodies and nutrients contained in breastmilk. Kozii's warming chamber is designed to accommodate a full 8oz bag of frozen breast milk, and to quickly bring it to serving temperature. SAFEHeatTM ensures that the contents of the warmer are brought to the same temperature every time as easily as possible. A simple, easy to read timer allows parents to set the desired  warming time by simply turning the knob. When the time is up, the warming stops completely, eliminating the risk of overheating, even if the bottle or bag is left in the warmer for longer than intended.",Kiinde Kozii,71.5,Kiinde,,4490

FuzziBunz One Size Elite diapers feature adjustable internal elastic in the legs and waist allowing them grow with your baby - from birth to potty training. Save money by not having to purchase multiple sized diapers as your baby grows, as this diaper fits most babies between 7-35 pounds.
Easy adjustable internal leg and waist elastic allow for a customized fit for baby without the added bulk. Truly reusable and earth friendly, the One Size Elite's Easy Replace Elastic System allows for easy and no-sew replacement if the elastic ever wears out.
Features:
Easily adjustable internal elastic in the legs and waist allow for endless customization
Newly adjusted sizing now more generously to fit a larger range of babies.
Easy Replace Elastic System eliminates the need to rip seams or throw away diaper to replace old or worn out elastic
Stretchy internal elastic is comfortable for babies while still tough on containing messes
Durable snaps will last wash after wash unlike hook-and-loop diapers
How it works
FuzziBunz One Size Elite are a breeze to use
Adjust the elastic - Make the diaper smaller or larger by sliding slits in the elastic over button holes. Once you adjust the internal elastic for the first use, you generally won't have to re-adjust until the baby grows to the next size - you will not have to adjust the elastic for every use.
Stuff the Pocket - Slide an insert of your choice into the pocket opening. Customize the absorbency according to your baby's needs. Two microfiber inserts are included with the FuzziBunz One Size Elite and it is important to note that most other brands of inserts/soakers will fit the wide pocket opening.
Snap it on - Place the diaper on your baby as you would a regular diaper and snap the wings onto the front to secure. With many durable snaps on the front of the diaper, its easy to find the best fit your baby as they grow.",One Size Elite FuzziBunz Cloth Diapers - 6 pack (Gender Neutral Colors),93.99,FuzziBunz,,4678

In 1982 Walter's son, Kevin, joined the company, eventually becoming president in 1986. Mary was active in the management of her business until 1982, retiring at the age of 78. After her retirement, she continued to be involved with the company. Through her 80s and into her 90s, she spent many hours in the company factory store.

Having led the way with BPA-free pacifiers, Natursutten is the safest choice for your baby because it contains no BPA, phthalates, or PVC. It&#x2019;s made of 100% natural rubber, from the tree Hevea Brasiliensis. And it features a patented, one-piece design, with no joints or cracks where bacteria can hide or accumulate. Natursutten is made in Italy by a family-run business that&#x2019;s been making rubber baby-products for three generations. It takes about 30 days to make just one Natursutten pacifier because of the curing process for natural rubber, along with the fact that many steps are completed by hand. Natursutten means &#x201C;natural pacifier&#x201D; in Danish. Anne-Dorthe Shroeder, the Danish mom behind the brand, started her company when she couldn&#x2019;t find a healthy option for her newborn son. &#x201C;The media is full of stories about toxic baby gear, recalls and harmful plastics. As a new mother, I thought about how many hours my son was going to have a pacifier in his mouth, and I was determined to find a truly safe alternative. I felt I owed that to my child and other babies around the world &#x2013; to do better.&#x201D; How to care for your Natursutten pacifiers:  &#x2022; Sterilize in boiling water for 5 minutes before first use, wash with mild soap and warm water daily. &#x2022; Just like toothbrushes pacifiers should be replaced every 6 to 8 weeks.","Natursutten BPA Free Natural Rubber Pacifier, Butterfly Orthodontic, 12  Months and Above",8.95,Natursutten,,4694

It obtains the body temperature reading with 0.3 degree accuracy in less than 1 second. The Santa Medical IR thermometer features an intuitive guidance system to secure positioning and confirm accurate readings. Temperatures (Fahrenheit or Celsius) are displayed on a huge back-lit LCD screen for easier reading even in total darkness. Adjustable audio alarm will alert you if the temperature is too high. Since there is no contamination risk, one can immediately start again to scan the temperature of other family members or individuals without having to disinfect or changing the tip. Santa Medical Thermometer was designed specifically for forehead temperature detection from a 1""-4"" (5-15cm) distance with an 89-109 F(32.0-43.0C) temperature range. Unlike other IR thermometers that only measure surface temperature, Santa Medical Thermometer is clinically calibrated to convert the forehead temperature reading(external surface) into internal body temperature which is one of the most important vital signs for human being. It can also store 32 temperature readings for future reference. The bright back-lit LCD screen displays readings even in darkness. A sleeping baby or patient will not be disturbed by the Thermometer as it is used nor will it cause any discomfort if they are awake. For public health authorities, it provides a simple, quick, Non-contact, and non-invasive way to perform preliminary mass-screening for H1N1 fever (swine flu) infection symptoms (body temperatures above 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 degrees Celsius).

BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? 
The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. 

Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream.
 Parent supervision is recommended at all times. 
They are 12-12.5 in. 
Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch. 
The Art of Cure Baltic Amber is guaranteed to be of the highest quality and made to the best standards.

5009,B0076NYZBE,[['Baby']],"Pack of 2 in TODDLER SIZE (yellow, blue)

The Snappi is a safer, more reliable, EASY to use fastener for cloth diapers that replaces the nasty diaper pins. The stretchable non-toxic Snappi hooks into the diaper material to make a strong closure. They work best with diapers that have a loose enough weave for the Snappi to hook into. (terry cloth diapers, cotton pre-folds, and others) They do not work well with flannel or other tightly woven diapers.

The TODDLER SIZE is better suited for larger babies and young toddlers. It is longer across the top 'T' of the Snappi. Once stretched correctly, the Snappi fastener gives an additonal 4"" stretch across the width than the Size 1 Snappi. It comfortably fits up to a 30"" waist. 

AGE RECOMMENDATION: Although this depends largely on the size and shape of the baby or toddler, we recommend using the Size 2 Snappi for children aged 16 months+ 

WARNING: Do NOT use a Snappi fastener on toddlers who have the ability to undo their cover and take off their diaper and/or clothes. 

How to use your Snappi:

To improve elasticity, stretch your Snappi fastener a few times before use.

Step 1: Hook left

Step 2: Stretch across and hook right

Step 3: Stretch down and hook center

The Snappi should go from a ""T"" shape to a ""Y"" shape when stretched properly.

Warning: Always use a cover over a Snappi fastener. Keep out of children's reach when not in use. Do not use a Snappi fastener on toddlers that have the ability to undo or take off their cover/diaper/clothes. Do not use your Snappi for longer than 6 months. Not UV resistant - exposure to the sun can reduce the effectiveness of the Snappi.

CAUTION: Any tear in the Snappi can lead to separation of a piece, presenting a possible choking hazard. Inspect the Snappi before each use and discontinue using immediately if there is any sign of cracking, tearing, breakage or wear of the teeth or any other parts. Do not cut a Snappi as this may cause tearing.","Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Toddler Size 2 - Pack of 2 (Blue, Dayglo Yellow)",10.75,,,5009

Our teethers don't cause an allergic reaction. Wood is always warm on touch. It means that our wood is not green wood or refurbished from old cabinet. All our teethers made from high temperature treated wood. It means that wood is well dried and insects disinfected. So this wood can't contain insects and other live microorganisms like in green wood. The other side: dried wood can shrink from the water and return to the original size when dried. The green wood is always full of water and can't be dried by normal conditions like dried wood. That is why it can be very attractive to insects and other microorganisms.",Barin Toys Wooden Teether Sticks,12.51,Barin Toys,,5051

5053,B007BISCT0,[['Baby']],"Made in the USA! The Squatty Potty is a wonderful health aid for the entire family. The Squatty Potty helps you to eliminate faster and more complete by putting your body into a natural squatting position over your own toilet. Using the Squatty Potty during elimination will un-kink your rectum taking your body from a continent mode to an elimination mode. This will speed up the elimination process therefore reducing the risk of toxic build up of fecal matter left in your colon. Using the squatty potty for elimination will reduce straining and decreases the pressure in the anal and rectal veins. The reduction of straining will help to heal and prevent hemorrhoids. It will also reduce the risk of bowel herniation and other damage to the lower digestive tract. The Squatty Potty is attractive and will discretely tuck under your toilet bowl when not in use. Its designed with a forward slant to ergonomically align the body for a comfortable and complete elimination.  Children love the Squatty Potty. It is an excellent toilet training aid. It provides them with a place to support their feet which helps to remove the fear of falling. They also don't have a need to hold onto the dirty toilet seat for balance.  The White Plastic Squatty Potty is very durable, and easy to clean.  Made of durable hard Polyurethane plastic.  It is 9 3/4"" high at the back and has a slight forward slope to 8 3/4"" in the front.  The Squatty potty is not a stepping stool and should only be used around the base of your toilet.
The size you order depends upon your flexibility and size of your toilet.  If your toilet is 14""-15"", from the floor to the rim of the toilet seat, or shorter you will want the 7"" to fit properly under the toilet.  If your toilet is 15 1/2"" or taller and your are fairly limber then the 9"" should work good for you.
If you are not happy with the squatty potty you can send it back for a refund  (shipping not included in refund)",Squatty Potty 9&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,22.46,Squatty Potty,,5053

Amber Teething Jewelry is designed for wearing NOT CHEWING. Baltic Amber is found in and around the Baltic sea where an ancient species of trees was washed to shore to fossilize and create the unique and healing resin we know as Baltic Amber. What makes Baltic Amber so effective is its high content of succinic acid. Succinic acid is a natural pain reliever, anti-inflammatory, and central nervous system calmer. It is so effective on babies and small children because it simultaneously eases their pain while also having a strong soothing effect on their nervous system - all with zero side effects! Used for centuries in Europe, Amber's natural anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties are perfect to soothe teething pain. Amber is fossilized resin, which warms when worn against the skin, releasing its therapeutic properties safely and naturally. All teething jewelry is knotted between every bead to prevent loss of beads should the string break (which it is designed to do under pressure for safety reasons) and fastens with a plastic TENSION-RELEASE clasp.Children should be supervised while wearing the jewelry and the jewelry should be removed from the child's neck while sleeping.WARNING: CHOKING HAZARD. CONTAINS SMALL PIECES! A new legislation came into effect February, 2009. It mandates an age recommendation of 3 years or older due to small parts.

5184,B007UK1CBY,[['Baby']],"Babies love to bounce and sway, and that's what the mamaRoo does. It still moves like you do. The mamaRoo is meant for babies from birth to 25 lbs (usually about 6 months), or until they start to sit up unassisted.The mamaRoo is truly remarkable. From planning to production, it was shaped by the expertise of designers, doctors, nurses, and most importantly, hundreds of parents. Our team used motion sensors to measure movements of real moms and dads as they soothed their babies, and guess what was found? Parents don't vibrate like bouncy seats or swing like swings. They bounce and sway.When w4moms set out to create the mamaRoo, they put motion sensors on moms and dads and measured the ways they moved to comfort their babies. While there's no one universal movement that everybody makes (that would have been too easy), there are certain types of calming motions every parent uses. That's why the mamaRoo has five different motion settings. Each one is a variation on the up-and-down and side-to-side movements research found parents making over and over again to soothe their infants. It's not just a tagline: the mamaRoo really does move like you do.""The next study involved the speed of these movements. There's a very real difference between how a motion looks and how it feels. Think about the swinging pirate ship rides at amusement parks: they look like they're moving slowly, but step on and you'll find that's not the case. The mamaRoo's motions were chosen for how they feel, and most importantly, for how they feel to an infant. What seems slow to an adult may be just right for a baby, and that's what we've seen time and time again with the mamaRoo. Using extensive field research, babies consistently love the mamaRoo and find it very soothing. As such, speeds are widely adjustable to control movements.The mamaRoo's seat reclines to any position along its axis.

Sophie the Giraffe is a must-have who enjoys widespread popularity and is genuinely loved by every parent and child.  Sophie the Giraffe has become timeless and cross-generational..YOUR BABY NEEDS HER! Why is Sophie such a huge success? Sophie the Giraffe is baby's first toy, stimulating EACH OF HIS SENSES from the age of 3 months. Sight: At the age of 3 months, a baby's eyesight is still limited and he can only make out high contrasts. The Dark and contrasting attention-catching spots all over Sophie the Giraffe's body provide visual stimulation and she soon becomes a familiar and reassuring object for baby. Hearing: Sophie's the Giraffe squeaker keeps baby amused and stimulates his hearing. To begin with, the funny sound Sophie makes when she is squeezed helps to stimulate baby's hearing, and then later, helps him to understand the link between cause and effect. Taste: A Sophie the Giraffe is made of 100% natural rubber and food paint, and is completely safe to chew, just like a feeding bottle teat. Her soft texture and numerous chewable parts (ears, horns, legs), make her perfect for soothing baby's sore gums during teething. Touch: Touch is the first means a baby has of communicating with the outside world. Sophie the Giraffe's soft feel, like baby's mother's skin, stimulates physiological and emotional response that soothe baby and promote healthy growth and well-being... Smell: The singular scent of natural rubber from the Hevea tree makes Sophie the Giraffe very special and easy for your child to identify amid all his other toys. Easy to grip: Sophie the Giraffe's shape and 18 cm (7 inches) size are perfect for baby's small hands. She is very light, and her long legs and neck are easy for baby to grip, even from his earliest days.",Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,19.49,Vulli,,5322

This will speed up the elimination process therefore reducing the risk of toxic build up of fecal matter left in your colon. Using the squatty potty for elimination will reduce straining and decreases the pressure in the anal and rectal veins. The reduction of straining will help to heal and prevent hemorrhoids. It will also reduce the risk of bowel herniation and other damage to the lower digestive tract. The Squatty Potty is attractive and will discretely tuck under your toilet bowl when not in use. Its designed with a forward slant to ergonomically align the body for a comfortable and complete elimination.  Children love the Squatty Potty. It is an excellent toilet training aid. It provides them with a place to support their feet which helps to remove the fear of falling. They also don't have a need to hold onto the dirty toilet seat for balance.  The White Plastic Squatty Potty is very durable, and easy to clean.  Made of durable hard Polyurethane plastic.  It is 7 3/4"" high at the back and has a slight forward slope to 6 3/4"" in the front.  The Squatty potty is not a stepping stool and should only be used around the base of your toilet.
The size you order depends upon your flexibility and size of your toilet.  If your toilet is 14""-15"", from the floor to the rim of the toilet seat, or shorter you will want the 7"" to fit properly under the toilet.  If your toilet is 15 1/2"" or taller and your are fairly limber then the 9"" should work good for you.

With as fast as kids grow, who could afford it? Now, with Dapper Snappers, keeping those droopy drawers up is a snap! The Dapper Snapper consists of a short piece of suspender elastic with snaps that fits in the back 3 belt loops of the child's pants and snaps over the outer 2 loops to cinch the pants thereby keeping them from falling down.

5409,B008STIQGA,[['Baby']],"My Early Steps is a soft-structured baby walker for use with infants who have demonstrated an ability to stand while supporting themselves against furniture or holding onto an adult's hand. This is indicative of completed changes in bodily proportion and sufficient leg muscle strength needed to enable the ability to balance in upright posture. My Early Steps is recommended for use with infants with a minimum chest circumference of 19 inches, weighing less than 30 pounds, and at least 8 months old. The unique shell design promotes a natural posture for baby &#x2013; the arms are used for balancing, which is key to maintaining balance while transitioning from one foot to the other, and the risk of shoulder dislocation caused by assisting adults pulling on baby&#x2019;s arms is minimized. Baby receives visual feedback related to each step as the view of baby's feet is unobstructed. The processing of such visual feedback by the brain is essential for independent walking. The adult also benefits from maintaining a natural, upright posture while using the walker. The lower part of the walker absorbs part of baby's weight and prevents the top part from gathering up under baby's arms during use, causing them to extend upwards. The wide leg openings allow for free leg movement and baby can gradually build up the upper muscle strength required for independent walking. The most unique feature of My Early Steps is the three-point fastening on the back. Situated close to the center of gravity of the baby it includes the lower point of attachment of the support straps. This is important because babies' center of gravity lies much higher than that of adults, making them top heavy. Positioning the point of attachment of the support straps close to the center of gravity affords better control for the adult and increased support for the top heavy infant. The support straps are easily removable and adjustable in length to accommodate adults of various heights. Babies can frequently tire of walking practice and want to switch to crawling. It is possible to let baby crawl without undue risk of entanglement - no need to remove the entire baby walker from baby, only the support straps. The three-point fastening allows for adjustments for baby's height and chest circumference (or thicker outerwear) and makes it possible to create a snug fi","Little Dundi My Early Steps Baby Walker, Tan",29.99,,,5409

These training pants have a layer of micro-fiber built in, making them suitable as a trickle trainer, but a pocket that runs strategically from the front to the back. 

Use our Step-up Inserts to boost absorption as needed. Now MOM can take full control of her potty training plan, and the natural consequences of an accident as she is ready. They make the child feel wet when there has been an accident. Pull-on Potty Training Pants are most like real underwear. They cause an easier transition from cloth diapers into the potty training mindset. You can make use of step-up inserts for added absorbency! If you plan on using more than 1-2 inserts, you may wish to increase the size. .Cloth potty training pants help to combat the disposable trap mothers can fall into. The disposables take awareness of elimination away from the child, leaving you potty training with nothing more than communication. Cloth potty training pants help give moms another tool to use in their potty training arsenal.

BALTIC AMBER TEETHING JEWELRY? 
The Art of Cure Brand AND Trademark is dedicated to providing the highest quality for Teething Babies. 

Baltic amber Jewelry is made for wearing (not chewing) when a baby is teething to reduce inflammation in the body. The warmth from the skin releases the active ingredient in the Baltic amber, succinic acid. Recent scientific research has proved that succinic acid has a very positive influence on the human body. It improves immunity and the balance of acids when absorbed into the bloodstream; it stimulates the thyroid glands to help reduce drooling when used for teething and soothes red inflamed cheeks. Amber's anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties are recognized by allopathic medicine as a natural analgesic, which will help to relieve teething pain and calm a baby without resorting to drugs. The skin's warmth releases healing oils from the amber, a resin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream.
 Parent supervision is recommended at all times. 
They are 12-12.5 in. 
Packaging is custom from The Art of Cure and comes with a Keepsake pouch.

The Snappi is a safer, more reliable, EASY to use fastener for cloth diapers that replaces the nasty diaper pins. The stretchable non-toxic Snappi hooks into the diaper material to make a strong closure. They work best with diapers that have a loose enough weave for the Snappi to hook into. (Snappi terry cloth diapers, cotton pre-folds, and others) Note they do not work well with flannel or other tightly woven diapers.

How to use your Snappi:

To improve elasticity, stretch your Snappi fastener a few times before use.

Step 1: Hook left

Step 2: Stretch across and hook right

Step 3: Stretch down and hook center

The Snappi should go from a ""T"" shape to a ""Y"" shape when stretched properly.

Warning: Always use a cover over a Snappi fastener. Keep out of children's reach when not in use. Do not use a Snappi fastener on toddlers that have the ability to undo or take off their cover/diaper/clothes. Do not use your Snappi for longer than 6 months. Not UV resistant - exposure to the sun can reduce the effectiveness of the Snappi.

CAUTION: Any tear in the Snappi can lead to separation of a piece, presenting a possible choking hazard. Inspect the Snappi before each use and discontinue using immediately if there is any sign of cracking, tearing, breakage or wear of the teeth or any other parts. Do not cut a Snappi as this may cause tearing.

5854,B00BIC5BHG,[['Baby']],"Pack of 5 snappis (2 pink, 2 purple, 1 white)

The Snappi is a safer, more reliable, EASY to use fastener for cloth diapers that replaces the nasty diaper pins. The stretchable non-toxic Snappi hooks into the diaper material to make a strong closure. They work best with diapers that have a loose enough weave for the Snappi to hook into. (Snappi terry cloth diapers, cotton pre-folds, and others) Note they do not work well with flannel or other tightly woven diapers.

How to use your Snappi:

To improve elasticity, stretch your Snappi fastener a few times before use.

Step 1: Hook left

Step 2: Stretch across and hook right

Step 3: Stretch down and hook center

The Snappi should go from a ""T"" shape to a ""Y"" shape when stretched properly.

Warning: Always use a cover over a Snappi fastener. Keep out of children's reach when not in use. Do not use a Snappi fastener on toddlers that have the ability to undo or take off their cover/diaper/clothes. Do not use your Snappi for longer than 6 months. Not UV resistant - exposure to the sun can reduce the effectiveness of the Snappi.

CAUTION: Any tear in the Snappi can lead to separation of a piece, presenting a possible choking hazard. Inspect the Snappi before each use and discontinue using immediately if there is any sign of cracking, tearing, breakage or wear of the teeth or any other parts. Do not cut a Snappi as this may cause tearing.

5863,B00BLBLR1I,[['Baby']],"The S2 boasts so many great features and is designed to truly meet the needs of moms wanting to feel confident that they have an effective, powerful breast pump to support supply while also incorporating features to make life a little easier. Like all Spectra pumps, the S2 is a closed system - a physical barrier between the milk and the pump ensures hygiene and motor performance.
The S2 is intended to rival the Medela Symphony, and even surpass it with some of its innovative features designed to make life easier for moms.
The S2 is hospital grade - strong and efficient enough to support milk supply. In Korea, where the S2 was first released, each baby clinic now boasts its own S2, to help new moms in need of a great pump to assist with establishing breastfeeding.

With a maximum suction strength of 300mmHg and the ability to be used as a single or double pump, plus a host of additional features, the S2 is set to become the ultimate breast pump to support U.S. moms.

Completely flexible, touch button with the S2 pump's digital controls. These allow you to set the pumping program to the speed and rhythm most effective for your body. The pump will start in 'massage mode', a short, shallow mode designed to stimulate your body's letdown reflex (start the milk flowing) just like how your baby tells your body to start milkflow. The pump will then switch to expression mode, a deeper, slower pattern of suction which mimics how your baby nurses when the milk is flowing. For women who find it hard to get a letdown when pumping, this feature really helps - switch back and forth as needed. The suction is also adjustable whether in let-down or expression mode!
Includes a timer and nightlight. This pump is also NEARLY silent!!!
You can see on the picture that you can adjust both cycle (how often the pump 'sucks') and vacuum (the strength of the suction) easily, and the digital display allows you to see your program at a glance.",Spectra Baby USA S2 Hospital Grade Double/single Breast Pump NO TOTE,188.5,Spectra Baby USA,,5863

Like all Spectra pumps, the S1 is a closed system - a physical barrier between the milk and the pump ensures hygiene and motor performance.
The S1 is intended to rival the Medela Symphony, and even surpass it with some of its innovative features designed to make life easier for moms.
The S1 is hospital grade - strong and efficient enough to support milk supply. Used in hospitals to establish a milk supply for moms with premies!

With a maximum suction strength of 350mmHg and the ability to be used as a single or double pump, plus a host of additional features, the S1, like her sister the S2,  is set to become the ultimate breast pump to support U.S. moms.

Completely flexible, touch button with the S1 pump's digital controls. These allow you to set the pumping program to the speed and rhythm most effective for your body. The pump will start in 'massage mode', a short, shallow mode designed to stimulate your body's letdown reflex (start the milk flowing) just like how your baby tells your body to start milkflow. The pump will then switch to expression mode, a deeper, slower pattern of suction which mimics how your baby nurses when the milk is flowing. For women who find it hard to get a letdown when pumping, this feature really helps - switch back and forth as needed. The suction is also adjustable whether in let-down or expression mode!
Includes a timer and nightlight. 
You can see on the picture that you can adjust both cycle (how often the pump 'sucks') and vacuum (the strength of the suction) easily, and the digital display allows you to see your program at a glance. Can be used with it's inbuilt battery for 1 hour on full charge or plug it in...it's up to you!",Spectra Baby USA S1 Hospital Grade Double/single Breast Pump W Rechargeable Battery No Tote,290.0,Spectra Baby USA,,6005

The leg gussets add advanced leak-proof protection and bindings are super soft against your baby&#x2019;s skin. Thirsties Diaper Covers secure with durable hook and loop for a perfect and secure fit at every diaper change. The generous cut of the covers presents a superior waterproof exterior on any type of flat, prefolded, or fitted cloth diaper.  The cover&#x2019;s roomy fit is ideal for chunky babies, over bulkier diapers, and nighttime systems.  The x-small size features an umbilical cut out for your newborn's comfort.  Want to get away with fewer diaper covers in rotation? The laminate that lines the inside of the soft polyester can be wiped clean between uses, then wash when thoroughly soiled.  We suggest one cover for every 3-4 diapers in rotation (excluding diapers with waterproof exteriors). The mission of Thirsties, Inc. is to make it easy and affordable for every family to choose cloth while simultaneously investing in our local economy and sustainable business practices. We are very proud of the fact that all Thirsties products are manufactured in Colorado, USA, by a group of very talented individuals, many of whom are moms who work in the comfort and convenience of their own homes. We delight in the opportunity to sell products that contribute to a happy and healthy start for your children while helping to minimize your baby&#x2019;s first carbon footprints.

Leg gussets provide advanced leak-proof protection and bindings are super-soft against your baby&#x2019;s skin. Pairing the adjustability in rise with our signature leg gussets, makes this wrap the most versatile on the market. Whether your baby is tall or short, thin or chunky, this cover will keep those messes contained!  Thirsties Duo Wraps are a very trim fitting cover. They are the preferred wrap for trifolded prefolds or trim fit diapers, such as our Duo Fab Fitted diaper. For bulkier systems and/or for nighttime double stuffing, we recommend Thirsties Diaper Cover, which has a roomier fit. The inside of Duo Wraps can be wiped clean between uses allowing for fewer wraps in rotation and greater affordability.   We recommend one cover for every 3-4 diapers in rotation (excluding diapers with waterproof exteriors). Both hook & loop and snap closures are available on Thirsties Duo Wrap. While many families prefer hook & loop closures because of the simple, secure fit they provide, snap closures do have a few advantages of their own. They are pretty much indestructible and are more unyielding than our hook-and-loop closures, making them more challenging to unfasten for a toddler who prefers to go naked.

Our baby boy just LOVES this thing. It keeps him entertained for an hour straight and for a 5 month old, that's a REALLY LONG TIME for a baby to be content on their own.It's design is wonderful in that it doesn't squish them. The metal hoop keeps pressure off their body, and the seat / harness gives them terrific support. If he gets tired, he just leans back and rests. It's FANTASTIC.Money well spent in my books!
